it is therefore “sinopen’' not “vermilion,'' which is intended,

and which latter is giren in our translation. Jeremiah, 0. xxii,
014, “ It is ceiled with cedei, and painted with “vermilion;” it
should be rendered “sinopen''

Some of the varieties 01 haemstite outwardly resemble mineral
cinnabar: hence another source of error, which the observant have
been careful to point out.

Our own country produces as line varieties of sinoper as any.
llill states¹, that the reddle sometimes sold in London, under the

name 01 Indian red, was much the lineat he had ever seen, and -

was from among the iron ore in the forest 01 Dean, and not from
areddle pit: it was not inferior to that of 00000 in the Persian
(1011,οο much valued ns Indian red.

l hope to have an opportunity 01 showing, in aworlr now in
progress, that this English colonr has been much appreciated, and
was famous during the best periods 01 the art in the lilteentb
and sixteenth centurias.

De Boot thus notices this variety²: “Hoematitis a sanguine
nomen habet, Germanice ‘Blnet·stein’ vocatur. Quanquam in·
tertium niger, interdum flavus, interdum ferri colorem habeat.
Strias antimonii instar habet. Dum uritur, minii colorem imi-
ntur. Habet cinnabari similem colorem.”

Theophrastus describes the Haematite ³, as ‘⁶ dense, solid, dry,
or, according to its name, seeming as if formed 01 concreted
blood ;'' he adds, “there is also another kind 01 it called xanthus,
which¹ is not 01 the colour 01 the former, but 01 a yellowish white,
which colonr the Dorians call xanthus.''

rls the yellow ochres are “hydrates 01 iron,”so are ttre red
ochres “oxides 01 iron,” and in proportion to the quantity 01
oxygen contained in the substance the deeper does the colour
become. The trit-oxide, or purple oxide, is the highest point 01
oxidation. The greater proportion of clay which the yellow or
red ochres possess, the brighter will be the colour. Our sinoper
is a compact heavy substance 01 a deep red colonr, soiling the
fingere when handled, 001 answering to our lndian red.
