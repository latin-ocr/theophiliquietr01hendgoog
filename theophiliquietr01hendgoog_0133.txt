and the varnish of Theophilus, the writer is seen combuting with
his error τ he evades tlre text, supposes mistake in the given quan·
tity and imperfect description es to the mode of making the var·
nish, questioning the intentione of his author, in order to render
his own idea teneble.

The followers of Ruspe, who see the Latin “messum” and
“ Amber,” in the word, ‘⁶ glaesa,” are still more liable to the same
physical objections ς it would be found impossible to dissolve any
portion of ember by strictly adherIng to the directions given by
Theophilus in c. 21, and it is indispenaably required that a pro·
posed resin strictly sulfils this condition.

On reading our author, the description given of the resin em·
ployed is clear: “et adde gummi (Arabici, Cod. R.) quod vocatur
fornia, minutissime tritum, quod habet speciem lucidissimi thuris,
sed cum frangitur fulgorem clariorem reddit.’' ,lt is impossible
that Theophilus, “presbyter et monachus,’' and therefore neces·
sarily familiarly acquainted with ‘⁴ Thue,'’ or ‘² Frankincense‚” as
used for incense, could compare with it any resin but one which
closely resembled it in outward appearance3 in such a case of
comperirem the clear and concise writiug of Theophilus, upon all
the practical subjecte on which he treats, absolves him from care·
lessness, and even did the question rest upon this comparative
evidence alone, copel or arnber are entirely out of the ques·
tion, neither possessing points of appearance in common with
“ Thus.'’

It vves therefore necessary in the first place, in order to deter-
mine the gum resin of Theophilus, to fix upon one which borea
strong external resemblance to “ Tbus.'’ The fine speeirnens of
the Arabio sanderac, whichexectly resemble the choice “Thus'’ viz.
the T. masculinum, corticosum, and seminecum of the ancients,
pointed out that resin, for it has the distinguishing mark, a bright
glassy fracture, which the Thus has not; or, as Theophilus writes,
“ sed, cum frangitur, fulgorem clariorem reddit''

But the term “fornis’? which is given to the resin will still
more strongly designate sandarach, if it can be shown that this
name has been applied to that gum resin. „

In the second process given by Theophilus for making tho

“Gluten Vernition,” he calls the sesne gum fomis “Glaesa‚'’
“supra dictum gummi fomis, quod Romane glassa dicitur,’'
(“ aliter Arabicunt,’' an interpolation in the Cod. Royal, Paris.)

lf it can also be shown that this term was likewise used to de-
