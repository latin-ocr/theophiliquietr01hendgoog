Wherefore, gentle son, whom God has rendered per.
fectly happy in thie respect, that those things are 0f.
fered to thee gratis which many, ploughing the sea-
waves with the greatest danger to life, oonsumed by
the hardehip of hunger and oold, or subjeeted to the
weary servitude of teachere, aud altogether worn out
hythe desire of learning, yet acquire with intolerable
labour, oovet with greedy looks this ‘⁴ Boou or vernoun
aare? read it through witha tenaeious memnry, em.
braoe it with an ardent love,

Should you oarefully penne this, you will there find
out whatever Graece possessae in kinds and mixtures of
various colours3 whatever Tusoany knowe of in mosaic
work, or in variety of enamel; whatever Arabia shows
forth in work of fusion, ductility, or ohasing3 whatever
Italy ornaments with gold, iu diversity of vases and
sculpture of geme or ivory; whatever Franee loves in
a costly variety of windows3 whatever industrioue
Germany approves in work of gold, silver, topper and
iren, ol woods and of stenes.

When you shall have re-read this often, and have
oommitted it to your tenacious mernory, you shall thus
reeompense me for this aare of instruction, that as often
ae you shall successfully have made use of my work,
you pray for mesor the pity of Omnipotent God who
knows that Ι have written these things, whieh are here
arranged, neither through love of human approbation,
nor through desire of tempora} reward, nor have I
stolen anything preoious -or rare through envious jea-
lonsy, nor have Ι kept baek anything reserved for
nyeeli alone; but in augmentation of the honour and
glory of Hie name, Ι have consulted the progress and
hastened to aid the necessities of many rnen.
