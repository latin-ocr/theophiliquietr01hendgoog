native, the other factitious¹. The native, which was found in
Spain, was hard and stony, aa was aito that brought srorn Colchis.
The seetitious (which does not appear to be a cinnabar) came from
Ephesus iu the form ofa saud, shining like suadet, which was
ground and washed. Hili iu his notes to Theophrastus² thinks
that this latter substance was the ‘⁴ sil Atticum¹’ of the Romans,
injudicionsly eonsounded, he states, by Vitruvius with the Oebra
Attica of the ancients. Hiii, however, produces no reason or
support for this assertion. The “Sil Atticum,” was os a golden
oolour, which was altered in its hue by burning. Tbe origin ‘of the
terrn is probably σύλας, fulgor, auro similis.

Therewere the ‘⁶ Sil Atticum,” Marmorosunr, and Pressurn‚ vei
Syricum.

The factitious cinnabar was more likely a true minium, the in·
vention or introduction of Callias the Athenian. (See Minium.)

The “Natiie Cinnabar,” however, os Theophrastus was identicai
with ours, it was vermilion, or sulphuret os quicksiiver, and that
writer relates the process of extracting the metal from the ore by
‘⁴ rubbing it with vinegar with a brass pestle in a brass mortar.¹’³
During this process the brass would be attached by the aeid, and,
through the affinity of the copper for the sulphur, the cinnabar
would be reduced to the metallic state.

Dioscorides tells that “a cinnabar is worked in Spain ⁴, aud that
during the operation the workmen cover the face witha skin
because of the (mercurial) vapours dangerous to inhale;’' be like·
wise describes the process of extracting quieksilver srorn cinnabar.
· Pliny, likewise‚ deseribess ‘⁴ Cinnabar or Minium'’ “whose pro-
duce we have called quieksilver,‘’ “ cujus vomicam argentum vivum
appellavimus.”⁵

Cinuabsr was the “ Minium” of Vitruvius, wbo gives a process

sor using it in staining walls of a red colour⁶.

Cinnabar bas been confounded with the ‘⁶ Milton ” of the Greeks,
which is ared ochreous'eartb and the most ancient red colour
known. (See Sinopis3 also Ezekiel, e. 23, v. 14.)
