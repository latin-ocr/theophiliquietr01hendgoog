CHAPTER LXVII.

01² THE Pvnrmchmorr 01² COPPER.

Tuan an iron dish of the size you wish, and line it in·
side and out with clay strongly beaten and mixed, auditis
caresully dried. Then place it before a forge upon the coals,
so that when the bellows act upon tt the wind may issue
partly within and partly above it, and not below it. And ,
very small coals being placed round it, place the copper in it
equally, and add over it a beap of coals. When, by blowing
along time, this has become melted, uncover it and cast im-
mediately fine ashes of coals over it, and stir it with a thin
and dry piece os wood as is mixing it, and you will directly
see tbe burnt lead adhere to these ashes like a glus. Which
being cast out again superpose couls, and blowing for a long
time, as at first, again uncover it, and then do as you did be-
fore. Yon do this until at length by cooking it you can
withdraw the lead entirely. Then pour it over the monld
which you have prepared for this, and you will thus prove if it
be pure. Hold it with the pincers, glowing as itis, before it has ,
become cold, and strike it with a large hammer strongly over
the auvil, and is it be broken or split, you must liquely it
auew as before. tf, however, it should remain sonnd, you
will cool it in water, and you cook other (copper) in the same
manner. This copper is called bumt. From this copper
you can work whatever you may wish to make, for gilding, in
ductile work, in figures and animals and birds, in censers and ’
different vases, in borders of tablets, in wires and chains.
Make auricalcum from this copper with the addition 'of cala-

mine, in the same manner as you have composed the brass of
caldrons above. When you have recooked this four or five
umes in small vessels placed in the furnace, whatever you
have cast from it in avariety of divers work, you can gild
in the best manner.
