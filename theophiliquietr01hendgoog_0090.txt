GLUE 01³ CHEESR.

Tus tablets of altars, or of doors, are first carefully fitted
together with the joining instrument which cerpenters or vat
makers use; they ure then joined with the glue of cheese,
which is made in this manner. Sost cheesc is cut very small,
and is weshed with warm water in a small morter with a
pestle, until, being frequently poured in, the water comes
away pure. Then this cheese, compressed hythe haud, is
put into cold water until it hardens. Alter this it is very
finely ground, with another piece of wood, upon a smooth
wooden table, end in this stete it is again placed in the
mortar, and is carefully ground with the pestle, water mixed
with quick lime being added, until it is mede es thick as lees.
The tablets of alters fastened together with this glue, after
they are dry, so adhere together, that neither hcet nor hu·
midity arc ableto disjoin them. They should afterwards be
smoothed with a planing iron, which, curved and sharp in·
side, has two bundles, so thet it may be· drawn by both

honde, (with which doors and shields are shewed) until they
are made perfectly smooth. They ure then covered with the
untenned skin oi a horse, or sss, which ie soaked in water3

as soon as the heire have been scruped off, some water is
squeezed from it, end thus moist, it is superposed with the
cuwl glue.
