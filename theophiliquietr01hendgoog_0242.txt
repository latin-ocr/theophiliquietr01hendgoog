“ The calcination os tartaros red and white wine is thus made.
Wash hard tartar osten in water, and place it to be calcined in a
reverberatory sumaize, with little fire at first ς augment it afterwards
until it grows white inside. Then east it into hot water in a clean
vessel, and dissolve it with a clean spatula, and when it has become
dissolved, allow it to oool. Afterwards pass it through a fiher, then
bear it upon the fire and inspissate that which is strained, and after-
wards grind it and put it into an uncovered pot to carcine, until the
pot is red hot, for one honr, perhaps3 afterwards extract and grind
and dissolve it in hot water and expose it to cool; afterwards
lilter and evaporate, again calcine it as before another hour3 dis·
solve, evaporate‚ and calcine it: when it runs upon a plate or the
fornace without sume it is then proper for melting crystal.”

“ 'lake clear crystal‚ as much as you plesse, and in large stenes,
so that it may be the aize of a hen’s egg, or half, and place these
pieoes in a brass or iron semel, extra-luted, in a conl fire, and
when they shall become glowing‚ quench these stones ol crystal in
good oil ol tartar, (in oleo bono tartari ¹,) white and pure, and
do the like seven, or more, times3 asterwards grind it very fine in
a mortar, and pulverize it well and siu it; afterwards put the
ponder into an iron pot, (caryfiu) and place it upon a ooal fire; it
is then quickly and easily melted. Know that when the crystal is
sol't over the lire, you should throw oil of tartar into it drop by
drop, and it will be easily melted; and when it has become snaed
caat it upon platea ol iron.''
