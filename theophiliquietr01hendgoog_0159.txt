at the time of our passage, had just been built3 it was scaffolded
for receiving the fresco paintings at tbe npper part of the vault.

Worltmen, under the direction of the painters, prepared in the
court the mixed lime which was to serve as the plaster. Aa two
plasterings are made, there are two ltinds of lime3 the first, a kind ᾗ

·of mortar rather line, ir mixed with straw cut small, which gives it
a yelinw colour; in the second, which is of a finer quality, they
mix cotton or flax. it is with the lime of a yellow colour that

they make the first plasteriug3 it adberes to the wall better than tbe J

second. The second is white, fine, and makes a rather firm peste,
by means of the cottum it is this which receives the painting.

“The workmen then bring the yellow lime and apply upon the ξ
walia layer of the thickness of about half a centimetre¹. Upon ss

this layer, some hours afterwards they spread a pellicle of the fine
and white lirue. This second operation demands more care than
the first, and Ihave seen the brother of the painter Joasapb,a
painter himself, apply this second couch of lime. Tusr wara
ruane nnrs roa urta uuutntrr ro svaroaars. If they painted

before that time, the lime would soil the colours3 afterwards, tlte χ

painting would nothe solid, and would not enter into the mortar,

which would be too hard, too dry to absorb the colours. lt need ,
not be said that the thermometrieal state of the atmosphere 3
abridges or lengthens the interval which must be allowed to leave ,

the plaster to dry suitably before pninting.

“Before drawing, the master painter smooths tbe lime with a
spatulat then, by means of naming, he determines tbe sire which
his picture should have. Within this picture, on the ground of his
figures, he mensures witha compara the dimensions which the dif-

ferent objecta, which he wishes to represent, will have. The com· l
pass which Father Joasaph used was simply a cane bent double, i
divided in the middle, and adjusted bya piece of wood, which
united the two branches and brought them together or parted them i

at pleasnre. One of the branches was sharpened toa point, the
other was furuished with a small brush, (pinceau.) A compass of

amore simple, commodious, or economicsl fashion could nothe
made.

‘⁴ The brush, which garnisbes the extremity of one branch of the
compass, is dipped into red3 it is with this colour that the draw-

¹ Acentrimetre is, in ancient measure, 4 unctam Aah, or about balian English
inch.
