were superposed. The term was retained while the process
changed, aad hence the different coloured fluida used for painting
orvriting, and which were, in either case, laid on with pencils,
were still called ‘⁸ encausta.’'¹ The word ‘⁶ atramentum” has been
similarly perverted. Originally representing a dark colour or
huid, it gradually was used to denote different coloured fluida or
“ inlrs” used sor various purposes ².

The fabrication os iuk by means os “Roman vitriol'’ (sulphate

ol iron) and oak bark, (tannia aeid) is oi more recent origin.
probably a century or two before the Christian ers.

Sir H. Davy, ‘¹ ou tbe Papyri in the Museum of Naple³2”
writes-“l looked in vain amongst the MSS. and in the animal ,

chmcoal surrounding them for vestiges of letters in oxide of iron,
audit would seem srorn these circumstances, as well as from the
omission of any mention ol sucha substance by Pliny, that the
Romans, up to his period, never used the inlr of galls and iron for
vriting. And it is very probable that the adoption of this inlr aad
the use of parchment toolr place at the same time3 for the inlr
composed of chareoal aad a solution ol glue can scarcely be made
tosdhe‘re to the slrin, whereas the free aeid ol the chemical inlr
partly dissolves the galatiae os the Ma, and the whole substance
adheres as a mordant.'’³

This is not certaia3 Pliny gives a mode for detecting sulphate
sl iren in sulphate of copper by the infusion of galla upon paper3
he says “it instantly blackens.¹'⁴

Davy appears to have overlooked the following passage in Pliny,
vhicb shows that aeid iaks were known bet’ore his time. “ Omne
autem atramentum sole perficitur, librarium gummi, tectorium
glutino admixto. Quod autem aceto liquefactum est, oegre'
eluitur.''⁵

atramentum is mentioned by Theophilus towards the close of
this chapter. Whether the “atramentum librarium'’ of Diosco-
rides, composed of three ounces of soot with one ounce os gum, (see
Dioscor. v. 188, Πιςῒ μέλανος) was intended, or thesulphate of iron,
green vitriol, “atramentum tectorium” of the Romans, is open to
