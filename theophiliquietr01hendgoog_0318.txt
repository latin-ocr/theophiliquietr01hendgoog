nilver with the gold into it, and with quickneos rub and grind
it with the curved end glowiug iron, until you feel in theonae
nothing but a liquid, and directly pour it into water. This

= water being thrown away, put the gold into the left hand,

and wash it caresully, proving with the finger if it be well

ground, and is it is, place it upona clean linen clotb, and cast y

it here and there until the water be dried away.

THE SAMB, IN ANOTHER MANNER.

ἰ Bur il the nature of the gold is such that you cannot thus

, grind it, take a smooth stone, and make a hollow three
1 lingere in breadth, and ol a like depth. Then lashion sor
· yourself a harder stone than it, small, so that it can be
ξ turned round in this hollow, and long, so that it can be fixed
ἰ and made firmlin wood, which wood must be three yards in
y length, and in the lower part, to which the stone isto be
, joined, it must be of the thickness os a flute. Abone this

atone, at the height of half a foot, this wood is pierced through,
and to which another thin piecc of wood, two palme in

¹ breadth, in which a projection is made, which may pase

through the perforation of the long piece of wood, upon which
thin wood a stone is tied, of the size of a foot, from which
stone npwards the wood ia nrade thin and cut round and
smooth, aothat it can be turned round between the hands.
These things being llius arranged, place the larger stone in a
basin, or a flat wooden vase, and see that the stone lie firmly
aud that the vase is hrrnly placed. And when you have
placed the gold with the quicksilver in the hollow, and send
and water above it, put on the smaller stone which is joined
to the wood, and holding this wood in the upper part, turn it
round a little between your hands, and soon, through the im-
pulse of that atone which is hxed on below, it is carried
round, and thoe, by tbe rotation, griud for sour or three hours.
SometimeS, however, examine it and prove it with the linger,
