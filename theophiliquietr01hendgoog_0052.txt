PREFACE· XXXV

The earliest mention I find 01 distilled linseed oil is
in conjunction with amber vamish3 it is to be used 33
avarnish, or 81333, upon painted subjecta, and it is 303-
1313331 13 3 3011301103 01 recipes relative to the Arte,

less specific gravity‚ and also 01 3 lighter colour than that which
follows, and it forms 3 stratum upon the darker and 3133333 vola-
tile oil. The darker volatile 01113 011133 301033 01 pale amber,
the lighter 3 very pale straw colour, almost colourless. They
unire by agitation‚ 33 3130 3111 1133 333311 quantity 01 water, 11 the 011
is 301 carefully decanted from it.

Maronianus, October 28, 1845.

This distilled or empyreumatic 011 should be kept 13 3 jar covered
with muslin 30 33 merely to keep out dust aad (1131, but toallow tlte
entrance 01313 and the escape 01 1133 empyreuma. ln 3 short time
this oil‚ which is at first so pungent arrd 011333133, becomes gradu-
ally 01 1333 powerl'ul odour, 3ηά 133133 weeks is 301 01 more un·
pleasant smell than boiled linseed 011. 11 appears to absorb oxy·
gen by contact with air, and at 3 temperatura 01 40⁰, F. becomes
flocculent 13 appearance, while at 70⁰, F. it remains transparent.
This is not 3 deposition 01 31333133, but the effectos 3 diminution
01 temperatura, the absence 01 beat causing it to become solid, 33 13
1133 3333 with many distilled 0113, 31 that temperatura.

Amber varnish, (and probably other thick oil varnishes,) would
be equally benehted thinned with this distilled oil; 11 313133 with-
outa pellicle when mixed with colours. Colours used sor 1131313-
iuga 33131333, such 33 13 1133 118131103 solid pointing, or glazing 103
301033 3331 3113310313, 333 3333133331 very pure, 3ηά without the
slightest appearance 013 31313, although it may be plentil'ully used.
It dries much more slowly than 333011133311311113310113331 hence
its great valae, as it allows the artist as much time as be requires
in order 10 blend 1313 3010333 and linish his work. 13 conjunctiora
with amber varnish it forms a vehiele which leaves nothing to be
desired, and which doubtless was the vehicle 01 Van Eyck‚ and
in many instances of the Venetisn masters, and os Correggio‚ the
different modes 01 pointing necessarily producing the varied appear·
3333301 the (11133331331100133331 masters.
