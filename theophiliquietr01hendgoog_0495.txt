during the process os refining the precious metals, and therefore
whether they were not accustomed to separate gold from silver, or
other alloy, through the action of these acids, which, attacking the
foreign matters contained by the ore, leil the gold pure.

The process, described by Theophrastus, which was employed
in order to procure quicksilrer from native cinnabar by rubbing

the ore in a brass mortar, with a brass pestle, with ὅξος, has ’

been remarked, p. 56. Theophrastus adds, “And many other
things of this kind other persons, perhaps, rnay attain.”¹

Pliny is rnore explicit, or rather the science had adranced since
the Greek had written, and the prediction os Theophrastus had
apparently been fulfilled.

ln the chapter upon gold, 1.. 88. C. 4, Pliny hands down this
remarkable sentence.

“ Terretur etiarn cunr salis grumo, pondere triplici misto, et rur·
sum curn duabus salis portionibus, et nna lapidis, quern schiston
vocant: ita virus tradit rebus und crematis in fictili vase, ipsura
purum et incorruptum.''

‘⁴ lt is also calcined with salt grumas, mixed in threefold weight,
and again with two portions of salt and one of a stone which they
call schistos: thus, the substances being burned together in an
earthen ressel, the bitterness yields it pure and uncorrupted.”

Should the ‘⁴ sal grumus”' be the sulpbate oi potash, (Gauron
salt) this, with the schiston, actin'g upon the common salt (meriste
of soda,) with the presence os water, yielded hy the salts and alu·

be liberated, the sulphur combining with the sodo, alumine, dre.

The schiston was of many kinds, one a sortus haematite, another 3
