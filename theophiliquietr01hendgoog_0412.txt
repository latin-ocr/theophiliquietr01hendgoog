itcan be placed in another curved irou, by which it is en-

corupassed, aster the fashiou ol the wood iu which the auger

isrerolred‚ arrd at the other extremity let it be slender, ac*

cordiug to the siae of the lower eud os the pipe which should

beplaced on the bellows. Theu pure and very sound copper

isthinned, so that the impressius of the 3311 may appear 33

the other side. When this has been marked out aud cut

according to the siae ol the iron for the longer pipes, which

are called grave, an opening is made according to the precept

31 the lesson, into which the valve should be placed, audit
³ israspad round a little tc the> siae of the rod ¹, and tin is

¹ anuinted over it with the soldering 1333, and it is rasped upon
one edge of the length inside‚ and outside, upon the other
elge, aud it is tinned over thinly. Which tinnings, before
the newly made lines are scraped‚ are slightly anuinted‚ the
copper being wanned with resin of the fir, that thetin may
the more easily adhere. Which being done this copper is
lotded around the irou aud is strongly bound round with an
1333 wire moderately thick, so that the tinned lines may
agrae with each other. 'l'his wire should be first carried
through a very small hole which is at the thiu extremity of
11331333, aud be twisted twice round iu it, and so be carried
down revolviug to the other extremity‚ and be there similarly
fastened. 'l'heu with its joinings agreciug together aud care-
fully lastened‚ itis placed with its ligature, as with the 1333,
before the furnace upon the glowing embers, and the boy
sitting and slightly blowiug‚ in the left hand is held a thiu
wood‚ at the split topos which a small cloth with resin is
fixed, aud iu the right cau he held a long piece of tin beaten
thin, sc that directly the pipe has become hot he can auoiut
the join with the rag filled with resin, and the tin applied
may liquefy, and he must carelirlly solder the joinl together.
Which being done, the pipe cold, „the ironis placed in the
instrument prepared like that 31 3 133333, and the curved

with glories, can hold the pipe firmly, so that the irun may
