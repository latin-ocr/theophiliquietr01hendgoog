ΟΡ coueosluo wtwnowa

When you wish to composa glass windows‚ first make lor¹
yoursell a flat wooden table, ol such breadth and length that
you can work upon it two portioris ol the same window; and
taking chalk, and seraping it with a knile over ull the table,
sprinkle water everywhere, and rub it with a cloth over the
, whole. And when it is dry, take the dimensione os one por-

tion ol the window in length and breadth, marking it upon

the table with rule and compass with the lead or tin; and if
you wieh to have a border in it, portray it with the breadth
which may please you, and in the pattoni you may wish.
Which done, draw out whatever figures you will, first with
the lead or tin, then with a red or black coloni, making all
outlines with study, because it will be necessary, when you
have painted the glass, that you join together the shadows and
ligbts according to the (drawing on the) table. Then arrang-
ing the different tinto of disperiere, note down the colour of
each one in its place3 and of any other thing which you may
wish to paint you will mark the colour with a letter. Alter
this take a leaden cup, and put chalk, ground with water,
into it: make two or three pencils for yoursclf from hair,
either from the tail of the marten, or badger, or squirrel‚ or
cat, or the mane of the ase, and take a piece os glass of what-
ever kind you like, which is in every way larger than the
place upon which it is superposed, and fixing it in the ground
of this place, so that you can perceive the drawing upon the
table through the gloss, so portray with the chalk the outlines
