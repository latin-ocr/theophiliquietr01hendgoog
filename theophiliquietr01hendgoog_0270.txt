whom the Lord had presoienoe‚ and whom he pre· Ι

destined before mundane ages and whom, ou account of
the simplicity and humility oi his mind, He elected, after
his owu heart, and placed over the people 01 his choise,
and established with his Holy Spirit, that he might uohly
and wisely regulate the conduct appertaiuing to so
great a name‚-oouoentrating within himself all the
power 01 his soul in the love 01 his Malea uttered
these words amougst others :-“ Lorii, I 11000 used tte
deauty os sip house.” And although it was lawful that
a man of so muoh authority and 01 such oapueious iu·
telleot should eall house that habitatiou 01 heavenly
worship in whioh God presides in ineffable brightuess
over the hymus 01 ohoirs 01 angele, towards which he
himself yeamed with all his soul, saying, ‘⁶ One throp
tave I desirecl of tlte Lord, that wid I aeolo tylem thas
I may duell iu tho house os tle houd ull tte dopo off my
life,·” or, as the refuge 01 adevoted hreast and most
pure beart, in which God truly dwelt‚ 01 whioh asylum
au intense desire again prays forth, ‘⁶ Reuew 0 ripis
spirit within rue, 0 Lord'’-yet it is certain that he
strongly desired the emhellishmeut 01 the material
