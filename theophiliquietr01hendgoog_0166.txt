Eraclius‚ the next author upon this theme, probably oi the ninth
or early in the tenth century, speaks of linseed oil, and os its use
witbcolours, in a more decided manner, in the MS. ol John Le
degree, in the trectise entitled “Liber tertius et prosaicus Eraclii
antedicti, de coloribus et artibus praedictis.’'

l'be Le Begue collection from Eraclius, however, contains
nanycbapters which are wanting in the Cambridge MS, which
only gives one chapter not to be found in the Paris MS„ “De
plumbarione auri vel Argenti.” p 24. These chapters have all the
proot's oi authenticity, and arc the source from which many of the
early MS. writers have drawn.

“ De oleo, quomodo aptatur ad distemperandum colores.’' “Cal-
cemin oleo mensurate pone, et illud despumando, coque3 cero·
damin eo secundum quod de oleo fuerit pone, et ad solem per
mensem vel amplius frequenter removendo poner scito quod
quanto diutius ad solem fuerit tanto melius erit. Postea cola et
serva, et colores inde distempera.”

“Put lime into oil by degrees and boil it, skimrning it; put
cernae into it according to the quantity os oil, and place it in the
aun t’or a month or more, frequently stirring it; know that the
longer it baa been in the sun, so much better it will be. Aller-
warda strain it and keep it, and distemper colours with it.”

This is a very curicus as well as vuluable'passage. lt is not
onlya proot' of the attainment os a great perfectiori in the art of
pointing “ oil ” as a material sor tempering colours in painting, but
it is almost as good a formula for the preparation of a drying oil as
could at this day be given. A patent baslately been taken out for
among cil with fresh slacked lirne during the process os preparing
adrying oil witb the per-oxide of lead; we here find the same
means employed during the ninth or tenth century, probably long
before tbat time, sor it was impossible that the Greeks could have
overlooked the action of the metallic oxides of lead or aine upon
oilol' linseed: the “ plumbum combustum et oleum,” “ massicot, or
minium and oil,'’ of Cornelius Celsus and the other Roman
writers nn rnedicine, produced effecta which could not have been
overlooked. Marcellus, who wrote under the empire os Marcus
