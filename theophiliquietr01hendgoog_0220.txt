round. Yon will then fashion two small marks outside at
each end os each piece of wood, according to the widtb
which you wish the rod to be between, and taking a flaxen
thread thio and twisted, moisten it in red colom, and, separat-
ing the pieces of wood, apply this cord upon one inside sur-
face, from the mark which you cut at the top to the mark be-
low, so that it may he firmly stretched; and joining the other
wood to it press them together strongly, so that when you
bave separated them the colonr may appear upon both pisces.
The thread, being taken off and again moistened with colonr,
is fixed upon the other mark, and you place the other wood
upon it aud compress it. When the colour shall have ap·
peared upon both sides, cut the groore with a knife as wide
and deep as you wish, so, however, that the incision may not
pass through tbe lower end, bnt at the top, where yon pour
in, it may bave an opening. Which being done, join the
woods together, binding them with a strap from top to hot-
tom, and holding it with the wood, pour in the lead, and the
strap being loosened, take out the rod. Again binding and
casting, do this until at length the burning reaches the bottom
of the incision; and so you can afterwards cast, gently, as
osten and as many as you wisb. When you see that you
bare rods enough, cut a piece of wood two lingere wide and
as thick as the groove is inside, dividing it in the middle so
that at one end it is whole, and at the other there is an in·
cision, in which the rod is inserted. Cut which, placed in it,
with a liniis on both sides, and smooth and serape it as it
may please yon.

with it a fifth part of lead, and cast in the above mentioned
iron or wood as many rods as you wish, with which you will
