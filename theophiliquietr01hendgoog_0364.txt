short and bent, must be tired on, or a pieoe of wood, with

which it can be revolved. You will then have two small
wooden columns tired upon a bench aud separated from each
other according to the length of the iron, each of which may
have in the front part single wedges, also wooden, in measure
a palm in length, and cut like a ladder3 upon which another
round wood may be placed, so that it can be moved nearer or
farther: upon this the hand of the turner ean rest. These
things thus arranged place, between these two columns the
turning iron which holds the “nucleus,’' aud the assistant
who may turn it sitting before you upon the left hand, you
will turn it with sharp and wide instrumente everywhere until
itis smooth, and you will so form these “nuclei'' that they may
be joined together by an equal breadth and thickness in the
middle. You will cut in the lower part from the middle
downwards, so that the upper breadth may by two mensures
exceed the lower, in which you will also form the foot. lu
the same proportion also you cut the upper part, the height
of which, however, will be such that it is cut iu (three times),
to the shape of a bell-founder's wooden (block), so that every
cutting may be slighter upwards. These being thus turned,
take out the iron, and with a knife cut, in the broader horder
of the upper nucleus, four angles as far as the nearest cutting,
so that it may be formed in the manner of a crosa, and let
each projection have equal breadth in the eides, but contain
in height a measure and a half of the breadth, in which you
will form also small pinnacles in likeness of roofs. You also
make in the next tower eight rihs, fonr wide and four narrow,
which you also make round, so that the angles of the wider
may project, andos the narrower be hollow, so that a round·
nese may appear; in these you will form proper roofs to the
aize. You will faehion the penultimate tower in the same
manner, so, however, that round ribs are formed over the
broad parts of the lower, and that the round parts of the
lower are adjusted under the broad parts of the upper. But
the upper tower must be formed with eight rihs, equally broad
aud without roofs. This will be the upper part of the censer.
