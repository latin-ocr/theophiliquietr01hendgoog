gloss vase, and agnin pour wine over the sediment, and place
it again in the above mentioned place, and they do this the
whole year, adding a portion of green. Those, however,
who wish to procure it sooner, grind this green with wine
as directed above, and then it is used for writing as vermilion,
or azure, it is ground with wine; you theu take the best wine
and put it into any brass or copper vessel, and you boil it.
This being cooked aud· cleansed from froth, keep it and
temper the green colour with it and place itin the warmth of
the sun, or a slow fire, until it has become moderately thick,
and puttiug yellow and the powder of calcined hones into it,
it contracts yet more, and better, green; or if you mix new
with the old, it will possess another green colour3 should it
have become quite or nearly dry, add a little water. More-
over, place the green in wine and rub it well with the finger:
this having settled, take the liquid portion and putitiu the
mild sunshine, or in a place where it can become inspissated.
When it has become fit for pointing, place itin a copper or
brass vessel, and you can keep it good for a long time.
Should it become darker, put to it a little saffron or powder
of calcined bones. Should you wish to illuminate more
speedily, take the yolk ol a fresh egg and mix mead or wine
with the green, and with this liquor grind the green upon s
stone, and temper with it, and it will thus be good.

Bnrsrn wood is scraped with a knife iuto avase, and white of

measure; aster this brisil has become matured the liquor is

withdrawn and kept in another vessel. This done, gleire
is again to be placed upon the same brisil, auditis to be
withdrawn aster it has become matured. This is done es long

as the brisil shall colour the glaire: beware of this, however,
that you do not temper brisil without alum, otherwise all the
brisil fades from the parchment, and the gleire alone will re-
