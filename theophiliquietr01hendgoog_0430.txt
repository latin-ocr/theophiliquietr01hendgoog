utterly withdrawn, close both openings with beaten clay, to
the proper measure, so that the rim os the bell may not be in-
jured, and supply wood more abundantly about the mould, that
lor the whole day and the following night the lire may not
be wanting. lu the meantime take an iron pot, round at the
bottom, fit only for this work, which must heve on each side
two iron handles, or should the bell be large, two or three
(pots) and you anoint thern inside and out with clay beaten
strongly, once and again and a third time, until it be two
lingere thick, and stand them on either side opposite each
other, so that there may be way between them, and place
simple earth under them, and lix them round with wooden
states, in two, or if necessary, three places ; where the bel-
lows should be applied you fix, strongly, two stokes equally
wide, aud between thern you make an opening against the
mouth of the pot, so that ,the wind can corne into it, and in
separate holcs you insert separate irone, thiu and bent, so
that the pipes of the bellows may be able to lie in them firmly3
aud thus you make over this pot, with stones and clay, a fur·
, nace around it, a foot and a half high, aud you line it inside
smoothly, with the same clay, and so apply ignited coals.
And when yon have done alilre to the separate pots, set the
bellows with their instrumente in which they may lie firmly,
two to each opening, and to each bellows you will depute two
strong men. When, however, the inside of the pot has be·
come quite glowing, cut, to each oue, two bloclrs of oali, dry
and thiclr, so fit that they may be able to fill the bottom of
the pot inside, and make an opening in the middle of them
through which one might pour in, and upon these place two
other picces of wood of the same size, and around place a
lrind of stakes, from thesaure wood, protrudiug from these
bloclrs above the mouth of the furnace. This being done,
you will weigh all the brues-work which yon have, or four
parta may be of copper and a listh of tiu, end you appoint to
each pot its proportione, according to its capacity. Then
going to the mould furnace, raise the covering above and see
how it may act. lf it should quite glow inside, run back to
the pots, and, first of all, put in some large coals. Then lay
