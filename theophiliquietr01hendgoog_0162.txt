had painted a Conversion ol St. Paul in frenco, a picture of three
merres in breedtb and sour in height. Twelve personages und

²three large horsea occupied thie rather extensive field. This ·

'psinting was certainly not a masterpiece, hut it was better than
that which would cest one os our painters, os the second order,
lrorn six to eight months. 1 even doubt that our great painters,
charged with a religione composition, would execute it more uni·
lormlywell; there would be more excellencia, but more laults
also in their work than in the fresco of Mouut Athos.

“When the picture is linisbed, they wait until the lime has
slnost entirely dried3 they then finish the ligures. They attach
gold and silver to the nimbus and to garments, they enrich the
ptintings with the linest colours, particularly Venetisn azure, and
they make the flowers and ornaments which decorate the interior
ol tbe nimbus, tlre stuffs os habits, the ground os the picture.
For this, the grosser colours, which were used to paint the ligures,
must be very dry, so that they may neither spoil the precibus
celonrs, nor the rilver or gold. The ligure finished, it is named.
hapecial artist, a writer, inserts the name of the personage in thc

“'l'his is what 1 observed with the greatest care in the church os
Esphigmenou, of Mount Athos. While the paintcr wss st work
Ι interrogated him, and wrote upon the spot, aud as under his
dictation, what l ssw and heard. They scarcely ever paint in oil,
became said Father J ossapb, to paint in oil we must wait until the ’
plaster bas become dry, and, as the colour would not penetrate
into the lime, it would be less solid.’'

From these extracta it will be seen that sand or silice is dis-
pensed with in the composition of the stucco, the peculiar action
ol which, by hasteniug the setting os the plaster, so much annoys
the frenco painter. The binding ol the lime is produced by me-
chanicsl means, instead of the chemical action which the process
ol Vitruvius and the later ltalians undergoes3 this would, by re·
tarding the setting ol the cement, obviate the necessity os piece-
meal work, which is not spoken of in the Athos MS. The
