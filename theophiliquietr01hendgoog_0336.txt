CHAPTER XLVIII.

ΟΡ ΒΡΑΝΙΒΗ doun.

Tnuun is also a gold called Spauish gold, which is composed

from red copper, powder of basilisc and human blood and

, ucid. The Gentiles, whose skilfulness in this art is pro·

bable, make basilisca in this manner. They have, under·
ground, a house walled with stoues everywhere, above aud
below, with two very small windows, so narrow that scarcely
any light can appear through them3 in this house they place
two old cocks of twelve or fifteen years, and they give thern
plenty os sood. When these have become sat, through the
heat of their good condition, they agree together and lay
eggs. Which being laid the coeka are taken out and toads

ure placed in, which may hatch the egga, and to which brcad
is given for food. The eggs being hatched, chickens issue

out, like hens' chickens, to which after seven days grow the
tails ol serpents, and immediately, if there were nota stoue
pavement to the house, they would enter the earth. Guard-
ing against which, their masters have round brass vessels of
large size, perforated all over, the mouths of which are narrow,
in which they place these chickens, and close the mouths with
copper coverings and inter them underground, and they are
nourished with the fine earth entering through the holes for
six months. After this they uncover them and apply a co·
pious lire, until the animale inside are completely burnt.
WhIch done, when they have become cold, they are taken
out and carefully ground, adding to them a third part of the
blood of a red man, which blood has been dried and ground.
These two compositione are tempered with sharp acid in a
clean vessel; they then take very thin sheets ol the purast
red copper, and anoiut this composition over them on both
sides, and place them in the fire. And when they have be·
come glowing, they take them out and quench and wash
thern in the same conlecti0n3 and they do this for a long time,
until this composition eats through the copper, and it takes
the colour of gold. This gold is proper for all work.
