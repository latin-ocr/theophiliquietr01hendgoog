blue 3ηά giallorino (Naples yellow) with it, it forms 3 line green-'¹
lle tells us that it is used by “pertrait painters,'’ “a miniatori.”
The terrn “ orchimiato” must have been overlooked by the Cara·
licre Tembroni, in his note upon this chapter, when he refers the l
ararica of Cennini to the gommagotta (gamhoge) os the present
day. Cennini uses the same term in describing minium, ‘⁸ Rosso 3

eun colore, che si chiama minio, il quale ὲ artificiato per¹ erohimie.” l
Cennino does not otherwise speak of nrassicot‚ which was much in l

use, both before and after his time, in ltaly.
'l'he Spanish² and Portuguese³ writers, who appear to have re·
tained the ancient terma sor 3 long time, call the prot-oxides os

lead by the name ol' “ azarcon ” 3ηά “ zarquaon.”
In the Tab. Voc. Syn. os Le Begue, arxiea is also defined to he

“ 3 yellow earth, fit for pointing with, and likewise usesul in making 1

mouldsforcastingcopper.” Thisrnust have been anochreousearth.
During the combustion of lead in the preparation os minium,
the yellow prot-oxide os lead is produced; this is separated from
the lead by wasbing 3ηά trituration. The rnassicot‚ suspended in
the water, is drawn off. This having aster a time settled, ia col·

Massicot is a usesul colour iu oil pointing is used alone.

Fortun, c.14. In the Tat. Voc. Synon. Folium is thus de·
scribed. “Folium is used for dying clotho and is a red colour,
and another kind is purple, and another is blue. 'lbere is another
variety which is made by mining, with the same red colour, ashes,
or the lixivium os ashes os elnr wood, and it is called sotium
stampnense, or stanniivense.”

The term Folium appears to include the vegetable reds and red
purples of the Byzantine Greeks3 to these may be added the vege·
table blue colours.

, Theophilus does not inform us from what substance bis solium
was composed‚ merely that “lolium isos three kinds, one red,
another purple, the third blue.’'
