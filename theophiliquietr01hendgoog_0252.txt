mented with a crosa ca'n be hutone of the three Divina personages:
this, adds M. Didrcn, is the invariable rule.

Until the eleventh century the Latin chnrch,aswell as the Greek,
fraternized with the Jewish religion. An enantelled crosa of the
Abbey ol Saint Bertin, a romaic crosa ci the eleventh century,
gives the nimbus, the character ot saint, to Moses, to his brother
Aaron, to the prophet who marks the elect with the “ thau,” to
Isaac, tc Jcshua and Caleb. But at the moment of the consum·
martion of the schism, this respect, which the Latin church formerly
entertained ior the personages of the Old Testament, sensibly di·
minished3 the Byzantina induente, alone, partially preserved it,
bnt in the fourteenth century the Christian saints only kept this
attribute. The Greeks continue the practIce unto this day ¹.

C. XXX. QUOMODO REPORMETUR VAS VITRIIUM
FRACTUM.

This invention appears to have been made· in the reign ol
Tiberius Caesar,·and to have led to the fsble of malleable glast.
Pliny, who has bean quoted ογ St. Isidore, mentions an invention
cf a composition, or tempering, which rendered glass tendet, and
that Tiberius, fearing thit would depreciate the value of the
precicus metals, abolished the worlrshop of the artificer. This
story has been wonderfully improved hy St. Isidore, who adds a
hammer to the tale, and converte the “tendet'' or “ tractable glass ’⁸
mentioned hy Pliny into one which is “ malleable.” Eraclius
quotes from St. Isidore, rather than from Pliny, whose version is
too plain to admit ol the marvelloua.

Pliny writes, “ Ferunt, Tiberio principe, excogitatum vitri tem·
peramantum, ut flexibile esset: et totam officinam artificis ejus
abolitam, ne saria, argenti, auri, metallis pretia detraherentur:
eaque fama crebrior diu, quam certior fuit.”²

St. Isidore, disregarding the doubt expressed ογ Pliny, that
glasa could even he rendered more tracubte,writea³-‘·1tisre·

lated that, under Tiberius Cesar, an artificer invented a temperiny
for glans, which rendered it tender and ductile ( flexibile at ductile).
