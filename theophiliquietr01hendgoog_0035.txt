xviii cusanca.

Another circumstance may be adduced favourable to
this opinion. The very few instances in which Theo·
philus affords iconographical description are emineutly
of this period of art. In the delineation of the beaten
censer, L. ΙΙΙ. C. 60, Byzantina art is particularly ob-
servable3 the octangular towers, the long columns, the
lengthened windowa the circular opening above the
centra column between them¹3 the rivers of Paradise
inhumari form, the raised arch at the bottom of the
censer, in which are the ligures of the evangelista,
whether delineated in likeness of men or symbolically‚
are all of Byzantina art; but in C. 61, the marks of the
period are yet stronger. The figures of the Jewiah
propheta fraternized with those of the apostles, with
their names inscribed above the head, each provided
with their testimonias “that they may agree with each
other ;”² the personification of the virtues, also with
the name inscribed; the Arabesques3 are not only By-
zantina, but, if introduced into the west, indicate, ao
cording to M. Didrou an early period of the eleventh
century. “ The East, where the old law was horn, al·
ways remained faithful to its respect for the Jewish
lau, and the personages of the Old Testament. With
us, the characters of the Old Testament, however ele-
vated in esteem and glory‚ are not equivalent to asaiut

decoration oi the thirteenth century, which M. Guichard and the
Abte Texier attribute to it.

place inscriptions every where. Thia isa great advantage. Had
our· Gothic ancesrora acted thus, we, archaeologists, should have
lesa trouble to specily, or name, personagea and subjecta sculptured
