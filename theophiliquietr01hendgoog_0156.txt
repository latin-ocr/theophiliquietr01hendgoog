“When you would paint a church, commence by the higher por·

tiam and linish by the lower. For this, you begin by placing a
ladder. Theo take water in alarge vase, and throw some witha
spoon against the wall so as ιο wet it. If the wall is built os
earth, scratch the earth with a trovvel as much aa you can, because,
above all at the vault, the lime will detach itself more tardily.
Wet it again and polish the surface. lf the wall is in briclr, you
will wet it five or six times, and you will make the plaster work of
lime, ol the thickness of two fingere and more, to retain humidity,
and to allow you ιο take advantage os it. 1f the wall is in stoue,
vetit only once or twice, and put a much smaller quantity of
plaster, for stone takes humidity easily and does not dry. During
winter, lay one coat of plaster in the evening, and another, more
superficial, the next morning. In the fine senson, do what is the
most convenient, and, aller having laid on the last coueh os plaster,
equalise it well; allow it ιο take consistente, and worlr.’'

‘⁶ When you would draw upon a wall, smootb its surface well.
'Iheu take a compass, and attach to both its branches pieces ol
vood, so as to lengthen it as much as you wish. Attach a small
bntsh (pinceau) to the extremity osone os these sticks. You
will draw out the nimbus of your personages, and you will indicate
all the mensures which are necessary. Then makes very slight
slretch with ochre; finish your outlines. ll‘ you vvish to correct
(effecer) anything, employ oxy (red ochre or sinoper). Retouch
the nimbus, repolish the surface well, and employ black3 polish
the drapery, and lay on the proplasm. Try to terminate'very
quickly that which you have polished3 for, if you arctoo tardy,
a must will form upon the surlace which would not absorb the
colour. Work the sace in the same mannen you will design the
outline witha piece of bone cut toa point, and put on the flesh
colour as promptly as possible, before the formation ol a crust, as
we have before said.'’
