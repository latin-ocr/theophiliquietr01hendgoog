A Ms. vn aaa punse 010ηο de Cambridge unr-

versity, was discovered by Raspe in 1779, and stated by
him to 10 10 110 writing of the thirteenth century. This
merely contains a portion 01 the first book of Theophi-
lus, withan appendix by the copyist collected from other
writers. A copy 01 1110 MS. isin the British Museum.
Sloane‚ 715. Ruspe states that this MS. is in 410, and
iu the handwriting 01110 thirteenth century.

Another copy was found by Raspe in the Trinity
College library, and is also in the writing of the thir·
teenth century. This MS. 10 now in the British Mu-
seum. It is that published hy Rasp03 it contains a
portion 01 110 lirst book 01 Theophilus, with 0 collection
01 1001ρο0 01 110 end, among which are to be found the
five chapters given by the Count de L’Esoalopier¹. r
which are not by Theophilus. These are neither to
be found in the Harleian, the Vienna, nor the Wolfen-
biittel MSS. It isin 1110 manuscript that the epithet
“Lombard” is given to the first book, “Sic r'ccipit
Tractutus Lombordious thliter temperantur Colores nd
depingendum. Whether the books of Theophilus are
‘⁴ Lombardio’' or not, it is an instance 01 110 estimation
01 110 writer in the thirteenth century. Lombardy was
the pupil of Byzantium, and this is corroborative 01 the
view I have taken throughout my notes to this work,
that the influenoe 01 110 Byzantina Greeks is every
where traceable.
