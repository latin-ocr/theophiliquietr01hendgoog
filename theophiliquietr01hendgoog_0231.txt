brated white glass, the most difficult 01 311, at this period, to
acquire. For, owing to the presence 01 metallic oxides in the
alkaline carbonate, or the quartzous fragments, the productiori of
a coloured glass would be of earlier date than a pure and colour-
less vitrilication. Theophilus provides for the casual colouring

elements.

The divers colours os glass not transparent, which Theophilus
tells us, c. xii, were found in the edifices 01 the Pagans, in mosaic
work, were doubtlcss 01 the kind which were seen in Egypt by
M. de Roziere‚ and the art 01 making which was transmitted to
the Greeks. Plinyl remarks upon 3 manufacture imitating the ob·

pavements and other ornaments in glass were used by Agrippa in
the construction 01 his batha. This kind 01 mosaic work, then,
served the Byzantine artists in the construction 01 the enamelled
vases ,which were so beautiful in colour and are now so rare.
These enamels are all opeque, and present the appearance 01 the
finest mosaics. Theophilus tells us that white, black, green,
yellow, blue, red and purple glass, found also in the form os
utensils, were used for this work hythe French, who were al-
ready ‘⁴ skilsul in the art ’' 01 working glass. Pliny, indeed,
states that Italy, Gaul, and Spain, pursued the manufacture 01
glass.
