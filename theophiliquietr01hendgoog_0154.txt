ter firmitatem,” and the colours allowed to dry with the wall
itsels‚ that they might addere, “ ut haereant,” yet this process, as
it will he see'n by consulting the fifteenth chapter of our author,
was widely different from the Italian invention os a later date, by
which the colours unite with the new plaster of lime and sand and
are lired upon the surface, yet forming partos the body os the
cenent itself. Theophilus speaks of lime, only in connection with
mursl decoration. ¹

llequeno¹ thought with reason that the ancients were ignorent
os the style os “huon fresco‚” and that the directions os Vitruvius⁸
“De tectoriis operibus'' were lor colouring the sursaca os tha
plaster before it hardened. He adds that Winkelnssnn and the
sudemicians ohserved that at Herculaneum, when some of the
pointings were wushed‚ tha colours of the figures, dte, were re·
moved and the even smooth coloured ground only remained. Other
ligures were painted with “ Punic wax and oil.'' Vitruvius cer·
tsinly nowhere speaks os pointing upon cernent, although he givet

The passage os Pliny³ “ nx omnihus coloribus cretulam amant
udoque illini recusant, purpurissimum, Indicum, ceruleum, meli·
num, auripigmentum, appianum, cerussa,” applies to the process
described by Vitruvius.

'lhe phrase, however, os Theophilus “ in recenti muro'' “ upona
new wall” cannot he overlooked. lt is not the ‘⁶ murus siccus'’ os
chap.15,but it appears to mean that “stesso” was intended
hy Theophilus. How then to coincide the neglect ol our author
iu this instance with his universal care in description, if “ fresco''
vereiotendedl Theophssus, who promises to teach us ull tha Greeks
knew in the art of painting, would not, certainly, have neglected
so important a hrsnch. The Byzantina MS. published hy Muratori
is silent upon the subject, Eraclius likewise, as also the writers
collected by La Begue3 and it was not until the translation ol tha
Byzantine MS. from Mount Athos, published hy Mons. Didron ⁴,
appeared, that any light was thrown upon itt Theophilus, although
he has spoken generally, has neglected nothing.
