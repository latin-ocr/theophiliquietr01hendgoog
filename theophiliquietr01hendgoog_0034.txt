very early and incompleta knowledge of their works‚

which he had probably heard of in Constantinople or
l

Italllohsieur Guichard‚ Monsieur Didron, and the Abbe

Texier assuredly have assigned too late a period, when
they fix the twelfth or thirteenth century as the epoch
of Theophilus.

It is remarkable, and isscorrelative proof with what

bas been remarked above, that there is no mention in
the “ Treatise upon Divers Arts ” of distillation, nor is
any substance indicated by which we can presumo that
Theophilus was acquainted with that art. This, coupled
with the preceding facts, will place our author in a pe-
riod of transition or among the writers of the early part
of the eleventh century. The school of medicine of
Salerno had hut commenced at that period to inculcata
the Arab sciencc, and to disseminate it through Italy.
Had Theophilus been cotemporary with Roger Bacon
or Raymond Lully, as Mr. Guichard supposes, this art,
which would have simplified so many of his processes and
which has added so many materials to art, would have
been noticed. The influence of the crusades‚ although
doubtlcss great upon the taste of Westem Europe, we
bave abcady seen could have but little, if at all, added
to the sciences. There is no art mentioned by Theo-
philus which was unknown at the commenocment of
the eleventh century; yet distillation, or any of its pro·
ducts, is omitted, although a glimmering of Arab science
is observable in the work.
