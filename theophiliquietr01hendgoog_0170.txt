italiana, the ‘⁴ moreau” of the French and our ⁴⁴ murrey.'' Posc
and Πόξος are therefore derived from the same source.

in the Tah. Voc. Syn. we have ⁴⁴ Morellus, est color ex rubeo
et nigro factus;” this is our murrey. The puros or morelle
appears to have dissppeared upon the introductlon of indigo.

The γλύιασμα or ‘⁴ sostening” of Pauseiinos² is thus composed:
⁴⁴ Glycaam.” ⁴⁴ Talse two parts of ilesh colour, and one part, ora
little less, of pvoplasrn, (a daris shade colour,) unite thern in a shell,
and you will have a glycasrn which will serve you ior making the
desh you wish.¹’

ln the same MS. the ⁴⁴ propiasm” spi πλάσμα of Pausellnos²‚
which ia correlative with the second ‘⁴ posc’¹ ol Theophilus, is thus
composed: ‘⁴ Take white, oclrre, green, hlaclr (the proportione are
leli to the judgment of the artist). Grind all this together upona
mathie, and gether the mixture into a small bottie, to imbue the
places where you wish to paint ilesh.”

This propiasm of Pauaelinos shows that he painted differently
from the method given by Theophilus, who superpones the ahsdow
colours, while Pauseiinos painted into, or upon, his shadows.

Pauseliuos oi' Thessalonica, a painter of the tweilih century, was

“lapis viridia,'’ agreen stone. St. isidore writes ⁴⁴ prasina,” that
is, green clay, which is produced in different plesse, the best, how-
esar, in Lybie Cyrenesi. (Lybia Cyrenes, called by Ptolom. Pen-
apalis, from the five sities it contained. Africa.)

The prasinus of Theophilus appears to be au acetate of copper,
oi which ‘⁴ confection’' he gives the recipes at the end of this first
book. Theophilus afterwards mentions ⁴⁴ succus,” and ⁴⁴ viridis,”
which appears to he “terra verte.’'

ln the Sloane MS. 1754, there is the following passage: ⁴⁴ Viride
