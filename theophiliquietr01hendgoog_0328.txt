everywhere, until ull the drawiugs are plainly seen, and itis

strumeut which has ahole ut the point, by the blow of which
you produce a very fine circle, und you will fill up ull the
grounds in the gilt ribs with it, striking lightly upon it with a

with puuched work. This being accomplished, place the cup

over the coals until these strokes receive a yellow colour iu·
