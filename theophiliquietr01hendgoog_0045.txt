the treatise abruptly closed with one chapter on the
construction of the organ. The description of this
instrument is now rendered complete¹ as it existed in
the time of our author. Au important description of
the manner of founding bells follows. The next, “Of
Musical Cymbals‚” tends to show the antiquity of the
author. Our monk treats of the more humhle vessels,
made of tin; of iren, with a description of the apparatus
employed in Damascus work upon steel. Then follows
adescription of the Italian work promised in the pre·
face to the whole work, of sculpturing, gilding and
staiuing ivory; of gems, pearls and electra. It should

be remarked here that Theophilus quotes Eracliusa l

strong argument against his Italian origin. The monk

would here appear to have travelled, note-book in hand. ἶ

to collect the various arts from different countries.
