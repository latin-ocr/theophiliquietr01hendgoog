diately removed, but kept sor 3 space, that, should the brass
sink, it may again be poured over. But should you wish
to withdraw from this fatigne of carrying and founding in
parts, procare for yourself a very large pot, which must be
llat at the bottom, and make an opening in it on the side at
the bottom, and cover it with clay inside 3ηά without, as
above. This being done, station it near the monld, not
larthcr than 3 distance 01 five feet, and fasten it round with
stakes, and lay in fire with coals. And when it has become
glowing close the opening, which will be towards the monld,
with clay, and arrange upon it four pieces of wood, 3ηά make
the small stokes inside the furnace, as above. Then‚ the
copper being placed in with ceals 3ηά llre, and three ranges
01 bellows being applied, cause them to be manfnlly blown.
ln the mean time you have a dry piece of wood of such length
that it can reach from the opening in the pot to the mouth of
the monld, the bend of this must be ample. When you shall
have covered this everywhere with clay and especially above,
interit that it may be even with the ground, but rather higher
near the pot, and heap ignited coals upon it. Thetin being
placed in and stirred with the copper, as above with the
curved iron which is strongly tixed upon wood, open the hole,
and with the assistente, who can hold two straining cloths, al-
low them to flow ont3 sometimes withholding, however, as
abore. And when the monld has become l'ull should any
brass remain in the pot, place a mass of clay upon the end of
astout stick 3ηά press strongly in frunt ol the opening that
you may close it. ln both these manners also smallcr belle
can be founded, according to the quantity the pots can make.
When the brass shall have become hard in the sunnel, cause
the earth to be hastily cast out of the hollow and the ground
outside to become somewhat cold. The earth being thrown
out, this monld must be inclined on one side 3ηά be laid upon
the ground, and this is done until, in the same manner as it
was placed in, it is taken out of the hollow. This being ac·
complished, it is laid down entirely upon one side, and with
hatchets and other sharp instruments which are lixed upon
long pieces of wood, the inside clay is bastily cast out, be·
