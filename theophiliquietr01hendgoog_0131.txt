the Gallie is called ‘ yene‚’ and ‘herre,’ the branches of which
being perforated or cut half through below, in the monthos March,

give out a red liquor which, boiled with urine, is ‘lake' with t

which the skins of swina are stained : '⁹ and again,

“Gum lacha ol the ivy is made from the juica or liquor
flowing in March srom the boughs of the ivy plant, cleaving aud 3

growing to the trees, if cut with a sharp instrument.” This will
be noticed rnore sully in notes to lib. 3.

The lacca of Cenniui is doubtlcss our ‘¹ gum-lac,” yet the gum· }

lacha os the Greeks was more properly so called, being a true gum
not a resinous substance. ¹

Another vegetable purple red, which will corne under the head
“ Folium,” was made from the “ Bresilium Lignum.'’

“ Braxiliunr vel Brexiliunr est lignum rubeum, a quocum pistus, ζ
roseus sit, iu lixivio sorti, vel urind, curn alburniue commiscetur, ,

exit color roseus vel purpureus.”-Tab. Voc. Syn.

That Brazil or Bresil vvood was in usa at an early period ior a
purple or rose coloured dyc vra have abundant evidence. Moser
speaks os “ rams' skins dyed red,'’¹ uhu algoru¹ ζόλοι o'rshhm, the
Brasile trec, according to Holyoke. This word has been rendered
in a French version of the Testament, “ jaune'' as if from “ adorn'’
la ‘¹ adamah‚” terra, and therefore judged to rnean ‘⁶ φίλων ochre.'’

The word Brasilium is probably derived from the Greek Βςάζυ.

The Pseudo Santalurn, vulgo ‘⁴ Sauuders wood‚’' from which-the
red colour was obtained, isa native of the East. Huet⁹ states
that “Sampisn wood, which is the same as Brasil, comes from the
East lnrlies.” It doubtless found its way iuto Egypt by the Red
Sea, and thus became known to Moses, who could have taught us
much relating to the arts os the Egyptians.

Thus, contrary to the received opinion, the country Brasil has ἕ
taken froin rather thau given the name, to the wood which it

yielded of so line quality and in such quantity.

Chaucer mentions Brasil wood before the discovery of the New j

World.

“ He loketh as n sparhauk with his cyeu;
Him nedeth not his colour ior to dieu,
