CHAPTER Ill.

OF THE went( Puunncs.

N ssa the wall, by the window, ou the leh side os the person
sitting, a piece of wood is fixed in the ground (three¹ leet iu
length) in width two and in thickness scarcely two tingere,
which, when it is firmly fixed, may have a perforation in the
midst of the size of a finger, four fingere high above the
ground. Let it have also in front a straight piece of wood
joined to it, and fixed with wooden pegs, four fingers in
breadth, and the length of which is equal to the large piece
of wood. ln front ol this you fasten another wood of equal
breadth and length, so that between these two woods there
rnay be a space of four fingere, and fasten that outside by two
or three stakes3 and taking clay, not beaten, nor mixed with
water, but newly dug up, put at first a little of it into this
space, and compress it strongly with a rounded piece os wood,
then more, and again beat it; and do thus until two parts ol
this space are filled, aud leave the third empty. Then take
away the wood in front, and with a long knife cut the clay
erenly in sront and on the top, then with a thiu piece os wood
beat it strongly. After this take clay beaten aud mixed with
horse dung, and make the furnace and its hearth, covering
the wall that it may not be burned by the fire, and with a
slender piece of wood perforate the clay through the opening
which is in the wood behind. ln this manner compose all
smith's firmaces.
