rounded top ean be turned, and in the other alike, opposite,
an incision must be made two lingere deep, in which the
round cutting can be revolved. Which being done take the
block itself and apply strongly beaten clay round it, first ol all
two fingere thick, which being carefully dry, apply another
upon it, and you do thus until the mould be supplied as you
may wish to have it, and bewere that you never at any time
superpose clay upon other (clay), unless that below has become
perfectly dry. Then set this mould between the before-ruen-
tioned planks, and, the boy who can revolve it being seated, you
will turn it as you may wish, and holding a cloth moistened
in water you will smooth it.

Alter this, taking tallow, cut it up very llnely and macerate
it with the hands, and two even pieees of wood being fixed
together of the thickness you may wish, you will thin out
the tallow placed between them upon an even board, with
the wooden roller, as the wax above, water being placed
under that it may not adbere, and so you will immediately tin
it suddenly, and will lay it upon the mould and will fasten

it round with a hot iron. Again,lhinning a piece ol grease,
in the same manner, you will fasten it next to the first,
and do thus until you cover the mould. You make the
rim of the bell ol the thickness you plesse. You will
turn the grease, when quite cold, with sharp instrumenta,
and should you wish any ornament about the sides of the

bell, os flowers, or letters, yon will hollow them out in the
tallow, and will fashion four openings near the neck, that it
may sound better. You theu superpose clay, sined and care-
nffly mixed, which being dry you add other above it. That
again being quite dry, you turn the mould upon its side and
remove the wood by striking gently, and the mould being
again raised you will fill the opening above with soll clay,
and you impress the curved iron, in which the clapper
, should hang in the middle, so that its extremities may project
³ outside. And when the clay has become dry, make it even
’ with the rest of mould and cover it with tallow, so that the
ἰ ends of the iron may adhere well in it. Alter these things
