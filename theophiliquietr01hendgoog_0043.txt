The most important, because the most voluminous
and correct, if not the most ancient, manuscript, now
remeius to he noticed‚ and which I was fortunate
enough to discover among the Harleian Manuscripts at
the British Museum. Owing to the imperfect classid-
cation of these MSS. towards the end of the last cen·

had withdrawn it from its hiding·place; classed in the
general catalogue immediately under the head of Tna-

‘⁶ Theophilus, monachus;” it has doubtless, therefore,
been classed with works on theology. It is not men·
tioned under the works treating upon the arta, hut
under the head “Natural Philosophy,’' “Physica'' is
found “Theophilus Monachus, de Chemia,’' a position
in which we should never have expected to lind our
author upon “The Divers Arts,” and which sufficiently
accounts forits neglect¹.

This manuscript is upon vellum, in octavo, aud is
written ina clear German characteres the very com-
menccment of the thirteenth century. Sir F. Madden,

the keeper of the manuscripts at the British Museum,

¹ Sir Frederick Madden amurca me that, although he was aurare
of the existence of such a manuscript, he was unacquaiuted with
its true importunae and valae, until it had been called for by me in
January, 1844, and he had collated it with the Paris edition,
printed in lats, by the Count Charles de l'Escalopier.
