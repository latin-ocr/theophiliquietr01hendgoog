abore them, and cover with clay. And when the clay has a
third time become dry, place iron hoops around so closely
that there may not be more than the breadth of s hand be·
tween two hoops, upon whichhoops place two layers of clay.

These being dry, turn the mould upon its side and ont a large
hollow in the inside‚ in the circumference and in depth, thot
it may not remsin thicker than one foot, because, were the

mould whole within, it could not be raised, on account of the
exceeding weight, nor be cooked through, for the thickness.
Tben mnlre a cave in the place where you wish this mould
to enter for cooking, deep, according to the height ol the
hreadth, and make a strong base, as a foundation, with stones
and clay upon which the mould will stand st the height
of one loct, so that in the middle a rongh space as a path, a
lontand a hals wide, may remain ou either side, in which the
lire can burn under the mould. Which being done, fix four
posta, projecting upwards to the level of the ground, about
this foundation, and immediately fill up the cave with earth.
Yon directly lower the mould aud establish it evenly in the
midst os these posta, end begin to cust out the earth on one
side, from under the mould. And when it shall bave inclined,
dig on the other side, until it again incline itsels there, and do
thus on every side until the mould lie in an even manner
upon the stone base. Directly withdrawing the posts, which
were fixed for this purpose alona that they might gnide the
mould down straightly, and stones which can sustain the lire,
being taken, and clay, make the mouth os the furuace on
each side, before that space ol the path which you had left in
the midst of the base, and build the furnace aronnd at the
distance of hals a font from the mould. And when, in
working, you have reached the middle of the mould, clear
the mouth of the furnace, and make an opening in the rim of
the mould itself, on each side, through which the grease may
be able to flow out, and vessels being placed underneath,
apply lire and dry wood. And when, the mould being heated,
the grauna has commenced to issue out, tinish the wsrm fur·
nuce from the font to the top of the mould, and lay a cover
orer the mouth with clay or iroh. But the grasse being
