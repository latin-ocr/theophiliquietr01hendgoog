Snnnnn you intend to make gloss, first cut a quantity of
beech-wood logs and dry them. Thcn burn them together in
a clean spot, and, carcfully collecting the asban, take care
that you mix no earth with them. Alterwards build a lumacc
of stenes audeley, in length fifteen feet and breadth ten, in
this manner.

First lay the foundation on both sides, a foot iu thicknem,
making a hearth in the midst, firm and even, of stoue and
clay, dividing it into three equal parts, so that two parts may
be together, and'the third divided by itself, by a wall placed
across. Then make an opening in each end of the breadth,
through which wood aud fire may bc introduced, aud build-
ing up a wall aronnd at the distance of four ieet, make again
a firm and smooth hearth throughout, and allow the wall of
separation to surmount a little. Alter which make, in the
larger space, four openiugs on one side, lengthwise, and four
on the other, through the midst of the hearth, in which the
work vessels are placed; also two openiugs in the middle,
through which the flames may rise3 and building awall round
about, make two windowa, four palms in length and one in
breadth, one on each side, opposite the opcuiuge, through
which the vaces, with those things put into them, are intro·
duced and taken out Make also an opening in the smaller
space through the middle of the hearth near the centre wall
of separation, and a window of the measure ol a palm near
