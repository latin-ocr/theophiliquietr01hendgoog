Geber³, io his notice of silver, tells us that, “exposed to the
contact of acid vapours andos sal ammoniae, it takes a beautiful
violet colour.” Any colour, however, procured from silver, on
account oi its liability to suffer from hydro-sulphureus vapours‚
would be very little permanent. Pure niver, however, will not
take this colour under such circumstances.

Lirinus, c. 16. ln the synonyma Magistri Johanuis de Gar-
landia, written iu the eleventh century, the word Limbus is de·
seribed as meaning the ornament upon the horden ot' e garment.
ln C. 60. L. 3, Theophilus directa that the names of the Apostles
be inscribed on the limbos or borders surmouuting the ligures

The word Menesch is Greek, the Romaic “turriele'’ signifying
“ violet colour3 ’' from this word probably the Turkish “ mene·

coincide with the directions ior the use of manisc by Theophilus
inevident, for it is used mixed either with lolium, or a little blaclt
and red, as a ground for a drnpmy, manisc aud lazur, and, lastly‚
pure lazur being used to lighten it. It is likewise used in con·
