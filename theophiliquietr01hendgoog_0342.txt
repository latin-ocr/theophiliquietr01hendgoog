it, and grind it as before. And when you have put in the
soap, misit carefully, and placing it over the live coals, again
burn it strongly and grinrl it anew. Afterwards pour in tha
lye, from the first vesscl, into thatin which is the powder, and
mix it and boil it for a long time, and when it has become
cold, pour it back, together with the powder, where it was
before, where you also put in four pieces of copper, by means
of which the powder may he mixed together as often as you
wish. With this composition gold arrd adver may be soldered;
but in saldering gold the powder must be stirred together as
mentioned above, hut in soldering silvcr it must not be stirred.

CHAPTER Lll.

ΟΡ APPLYING THE somn UPON GOLD.

¹ Tnnss things thus arranged, take those two pieces of gold
ἵ from which you formed the handle, aud place them before
you, and lay upon them the gems which you wish to apply,
and the pearls, each one in its place. Then beat gold flue
and long, and draw from it wires, thick, middling and fine, ¹
and file them with the instrument indicated above, so that
beeds may be formed upon them. These being re-cooked,
the gems being replaced and attached one by one, you will
adapta piece of the larger wire, with the fine pincers, about
the edge of the handle in both its pieces, and with the cutting
pincers you make very fine incisione nround them, by which
you will fix these wires that they may not fall off, until they
are soldered. Alterwards take a piece of gold thiu and
smoothed with the⁴ wooden mallet, and fasten upon it smaller
vires very orderly, sb that they may not be close together,
' bntmay have spaces between thcm3 at their extremities fine
incisione are made in the thin gold by which they are flrred.
The small vase being taken in which is the soldering, agitate
it strongly, that the powder may be mixed together, and with
afinc pen anoint this solder upon the gold and over the wires
nnnuy everywhere, aud place it in the flre, and you will
