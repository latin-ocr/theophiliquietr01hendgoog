form with their urns, from which may be poured a likcness
of flowing water. In the angles, by which the circles are
joined together, the heads of lions, or human faces, of which
we hare before spoken, may be fixed, so that the faces may
adbere in the lower part in which the chains are fixed, and in
the upper, the manes or hair through which these chains may
pass. But if the foot cannot be beaten with the lower part
itself, it is made alone, in cast or beaten work, and can be
placed on with the solder made with silvei· and copper, of
which we bave before spoken. Also the lily, to which the
ring is attached and to which the chains are fixed above, is
similarly made with ductile or molten work, in which flowers,
or small birds or beasts are formed, according to the quality
of the labour below. lf this censer be silver or brass, it can
be gilt in the manner before mentioned.

But should any one wish to apply more labour, so as to

it with water, and beat it strongly, and make two masses of
it of the sinc which you wish the censer to possess, one lower,
and another upper (mass) which will be wider; these lumps
are called the “ nuclei.'' You will directly picrce these with
apiece of wood cut lengthwise, smoothly upon the four
sides, and will thus dry them in the sun. Afterwards pass
an iron through them, which is called the turning iron, long and
rather slender, which is thicker at one end, smoothly beaten
anthe four sides, end diminishing more and more slenderly
towards the point; in the thicker part of this another iron
