green, mixed in the same manner, without succus, and be-
tween thern let a white trait be made. Then mix, from cin·
nabar and white, what tints yon wish, so that the first may
possess little cinnabar, the second more, the third more
still, the fourth yet more, until you arrive at pure cinnabar.
Then mix 8 little red with the last3 then use pure red. Alter
this mix red with black 3 at the last use black. ln a similar
manner mingle together colours from green and white, until
you arrive at pure green. Then add to it a little succus, mix
again, 8ηά add more succus, alter this admix a little blank,
then more, at last pure blach. But you make shadows on
ochre with red 3 black being added at the last. Shadow ma·
nisc with folium, black being added at the last. Shadow fo·
lium with red, black being added at the last. These colours are
so apphed, that the paler tiuts may issue from the centre and
so increase until they arrive at the black, outside. More than ·
twelve of these traits may never exist in each colour; and, if
you wish as many, so temper the mixtures, that you place the
pure colourin the seventh row. lf you wish nine, place'the pure
colour in the sixth row. If you wish eight or seven, place the
pure eolour in the fifth. lf you wish six, in the fourth. lt five,
in the third. If four or three, do not interpose any pure co·
lour, but leave that one for a pure colour which should have
been placed before the pure colour, and mingle its shadow co·
lour towards the outer black. ln this manner circular and
quadrangular thrones are made, and drawings round borders,
and branches of trees with their bonghs, and columns 8ηά
round towers and seats, and whatever yon wish should ap-
pear round. Arches ¹are also-made upon columns in houses
hythe same means, but in one colour, so that the inner part
iswbite and the outerblack. Ronnd towers are made of ochre,
and so that the white stroke may be in the middle, 8ηά on
either side may spread quite apale ochre and alittle inclining
to saffron colour until the last plan but one; with which a little
red is mixed3 then more, so however, that neither pure ochre
nor pure red may appear. ln the same way and with the
same mixture round towers are made with black and white

Branches of trees are mixed from green and ochre, a little
