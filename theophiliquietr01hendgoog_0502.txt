We hare already seen that the ancients were aware of the action
upon metals of substances calculated to produce the mineral acids
iu the art of relining, and that the Arab alchemists have described
these acids in unequivocal terms.·-Nnmbers, letters, the signs os
the nodiac, animala, planta and organic substances, form the syrn-
bolic vocabulary os the alchemists of this period. The basiliae,
the (tragon, the red and green lions, were the sulphates of copper
and os ir0n3 the yellow lion, of the yellow sulphurets3 the blaclr
eagle‚ the blaclr sulphurets; the red lion was sometimes cinnabar;
the salamander‚ flre; milk os a blaclr con, mercury; the egg,
gold; the red dragon, cinnabar; dcc„ &n Unfortunately each
chemist appears to have varied the symbols in use ¹.

The toad, “ ugly and venomous, bears yet a rnscrous unwan in
its head‚'’² the toads of Theophilus which hatch the egga, are
probably fragments ol the mineral salt, nitrate os potash‚ which
would yield one os tbe elementa of the solvent for gold; the blood
of a red man, which has been dried and ground, probably a mu-
, riate os ammonia3 fine cartha muriate of soda (common salt);
the cocks, the sulphates os copper and iron3 the egga, gold ore3
the hatched ehickens, which requires stone parentent, sulphuric
aeid produced by burning these in a stone vessel, collecting the
lumes3 these are then all digested together tempered witha sharp
acid. The elementa of nitro-muriatie acid are all here, the sol-
veut lor gold.

Geber tell us that the salt drawn from the ashes of a mole will
convert copper into gold. “ sal totins talpoe combustae con-
gelat Mercurium et Venerem convertit in Solem, et Martem in
Lunam.''
