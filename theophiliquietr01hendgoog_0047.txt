century¹. Ruspe has sufficiently and successfully op⁴
posed the assertion of Vasari; and the mention, by
Vasari himself, of the picture in oil, painted by Lippo
Dalmesio at Bologna, in 1407, is sufficient confutation
of the tale. The passages from Eraclius eud Cenuino‚
which Ι have given iu the above-named notes, are suffi-
cient to prove that the art of using driers with oil in
the process of paintiug. so as to render the work less
tedicus, was likewise known previously to the time of
Van Eyck3 the opinion of Ruspe ², in which M. Guichard
coincides, is not therefore tenable.

Α third supposition was started by Emeric David ⁸,
that pointing in oil, having been abandoned in the
tenth or eleventh century, had been invented ancwin
the fifteenth by J olm Van Eyck. This is open to equel

objection, as the English authors referred to above have ἵ
shown3 and it is singular that some of the materiale l

used for the purpose of painting the ehapel of St.
Stephen‚ in 1350, were procured from Bruges: “the
sum of four shilliugs and ten peuce was paid to ‘Lomyn
de Bruges’ for six pounds and a half of white vamish
at uine peuce per pound.''

Yet that Ven Eyck merely pursued the path which
had been previously trodden‚ uo one cau admit who
has compared his works even with those of modern
times, which we know to have been painted with oil
simply, (the more ancient works having disappeared
partly on that account, and partly from the class of
colours in use, as will be secu by a reference to notes
