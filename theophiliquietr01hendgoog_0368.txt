angle, next the stones, you make small windows. This will be
alikeness of which the prophet says: “ On the East three
gates3 on the North three gates 3. on the South three gntes;
and on the West three gates.'’ ln the four angles which are
between the divisions of the doors, you will form single round
turrets, through which the chains will pass. These things
thus disposed, you make on the topos the upper tower, in the
square spaces, single entire ligures of angcls, (with their
shields and lances as if standing on guard upon the walls, and
in the round turrets you will fashion small columns with their
capitale and bases. ln the same manner you make in the last

Iu thelower part, similarly covered with wax, you will form
