lu making the wind-chamber, join together two pieces ol wood

them be round at one end, like a shield, and there a foot and
ahall wide, at the other end blunt, a palm in hreadth. When
these hare been carelhlly fitted together, cut, in the round
front in the thicker wood, the openings which you wish, ac·
