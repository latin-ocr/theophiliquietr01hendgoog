things osten happen through carelessness or negligence, orig·
norance or unskilfulness of the founder, when it is east either
too hot ortoo cold, or in too great haste, ortoo slowly. When
you have considerately and cautiously cast it, should you
perceive a fault of thie kind init, carefully sculp it out with
the instrument fit for this work, if you can. But should the
bubble or lissure be of such depth that you cannot dig it out,

you must again melt it, aud so until itisbeeome sound. When
it has become so, see beforehand that the anvils and your
hammers, with which you should work, are quite smooth and
polished; and take care that the gold or silver plate be
so equally thinned everywhere, that it be in no place thieker
than in another. And when it has been thinned so that the
nail, slightly pressed upon it, may show upon the other side,
and it is perfectly sound, directly portray the figures you may
vish, according to your will. You design, also, in that part
which is seen to be the most sound and beautiful, geutly how-
ever, and so that it may slightly appear on the other side.
You will then with a curved iron, well polished, gently rub
the head, in the first place, which must be more raised 3 and
so turning the plata upon the right side you will rub around
the head, also with the srnooth and polished iron, so that the
ground may descend and the head be raised, and you directly
beat around the head with a middling sized hammer upon the
anvil, gently, and you thus cook it before the fornace, until it
glows, ceals being superposed in that place. Which being
done, and the plats cooled by itself, you will again rub it
with the curved instrument on the underneath part, inside
the hollow of the head, slightly and carefully, and turning
the plate you will again rub with the smooth iron upon the
upper part, and you depress the ground that the relief of the
head may be raised, and again gently striking it with the
middling hammer about this, you recook it, by applying the
coals; and thus you act osten, by carefully raising it inside
and outside and frequently hemmenng, as oflen cooking
until the relief is brought to the height of three or four fingers,
armore or less, according to the number of the figures lf,
