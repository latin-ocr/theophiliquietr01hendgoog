Turn rings are also made from iron, which are placed upon
the bundles ol iron instrumente, which cannot be made
firm by themselves, a thin piece of copper is folded round
these at the join, and a little clay is placed around it. This
being dry, when, being blown upon, it has become glowing
under the coals before the furnace, the melted copper in·
stantly flows around and solders it ln this manner also
tinned keys, and any other things in iron can he soldered.
But should you wish to make locks with which clothes cbests
are fastened, beat a thiu piece ol iron, and bend it round
another round iron, and join a bottom to it above and below.
Then place round it small hoops of the same iron, and he·

also two parts of copper and a third os tin, and grind it with
the pestle in an iron vase very finely, and burning the wine·
stone, add to it a little salt and mix it with water,and anoint-
ing it aronnd sprinkle this powder about it. Which being
dry, you again overlay this mixture more thickly‚ and placing
it upon the embers and carefully covering it about, as tbe
silver above, you will solder it in the same manner3 and,
having cooled by itself, you will wash it. Yon can solder
whatever you wisb, in iron, in this manner, which can,
however, in no way be gilt. Whatever you may wish to tin
over, in iron, file it first, and before you may touch it with
the band, throw it newly filed into a pot ol melted tin with
grease, and stir it with the tongs until it becomes white, and
being taken out, shake it strongly, and clean it with bran and
a linen cloth. When you bave madeiron looks and bindings of
caskets and doors, you warm them lastly and anoint them with
pitch, buttbe nails are tinned. When you have made the stir-
