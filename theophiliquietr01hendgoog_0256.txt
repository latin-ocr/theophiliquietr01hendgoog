The fact, as related hy Bede, the Saxon chronicler, of the im·
portation from Erance and Italy, into our own country, 01 arti·
licere in glass, (an. otu) by Wilfrid, Bishop of York, and Biscop
his friend, had an important influence upon this branch of art in
England. “When the work (01 St, Peter's) was far adfancedl’
writes Bede, ‘'‘he sent agents 10 france to procure, if possible,
some glass rnakers, a kind 01 artificers quite unknown in England,
and to bring thern over to glane the windows 01 his church and
monastery. These agents were successful, and brought several
glass makers with rhem, who not only performed the work re·
quired by Benedict Bisc0p‚ but instructed the English in the art
of making glans for windows, lampa, drinking vessels,” dc.—
Bede, Hist Abbot. Weremuthen.

Emeric David states that che English, in their turn, instructed
the Germane in this art.

the the influence 01 the style of the preceding ages was sens-
ibly felt during the 14111 century, the remarkable progress in the
arte of painting and design before the close of that era greatly 01-
fected this art, while at tlte same time the route previously fol·
lowed was not much deviated from. The Florentiae end other
schools 01 art had arisen in Italy.

Still the coloured and ornamented grounds prevailed, the painted

windows in the cathedrals of Bourges, Clermont, Chartres, dre„ ι

show that the circles, flourishes, and other ornaments of the llth
century, described ‚by Theophilus, yet held their places, but the
subjecte were better portrayed3 1ο the experience of the past was
added the new-born genius of Italy, and the art which the Byzan·
tine Greeks had transmitted to Western Europe approached the·
summit of excellence. ·
