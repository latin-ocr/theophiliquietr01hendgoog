becarried round and the pipe remain still, until it appear
elegant to the eyes, as if turned. 'l'he iron being then
taken out, the pipe is struck slightly with the hammer near
the opening, above and below, so that this round shape may

1 depress almost to the centre sor a space of two lingere ; the
, nire may be made from copper somewhat thicker, like a
hali rhed, and be soldered over about the round part, as
the pipe above, and be so placed iu the lower part of the
opening that its edge may stand equally under it, nor pro-
. trude below or above. He cau have also a soldering iron of
¹ the same breadth and roundness as is the valve. With this,
heated, he can place sinall particles ostiu upon the valve,
anda little resin, and can carefully pass over the hot iron
that he may not move the valve, but that the tin being melted
itmay so adhere that no wind can come out in its circnm-
lerence, unless only into the upper opening. Which being done
he can bring it to his mouth and blow at first slightly, then
more, and then etrongiy; and according to what he discerne
byhesring, he can arrange the sound, so that if he wish it
strong, the opening is mede wider; if slighter, however, it is
made narrowsr. ln this order all the pipes are made; he can
make the measure of each, from the valve upwards, according
to the rule inculcared, but from the valve below, all will be of
one measure and of the same thickness ¹.
