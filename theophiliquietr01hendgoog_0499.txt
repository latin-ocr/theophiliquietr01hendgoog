The lees of wine (scer vini) were burnt hythe ancients‚ and the
cinders, being preserved, were applied to the same purposes as the
potash, or sodo, the cinders of vegetables. “Cinia foecis vini nitri
naturam habet, easdemque vires, hoc amplius, quo pinguior sen·

again evaporated, produced the wine-stone of our author, the bi-
rartrate ol potass, or cream of tartar, of commerce. It is here
directed to be used as a dux, as is the borate of soda in chap. 29.

in Paris, one at the Bibliotheque Royale, another at the Biblio-
theque de l'Arsenal.
