11001110 the pot, and that the invention 00010 called upon to
notice, as next in rotatim, is 1110100111οἀ of colouring white glass
by means of a flux, “vitri lucidissimi.” ln c. la and 13, Theo·
philus does 001 neglect the mention of this process, whereby he'
tells us that “the Fnancrr made costly 010100 01 sapphira, purple
and green, very useful in windows,” and in c. lt, he infame us
that the “vitrum clarissimum,” used 00 0 flurs, 000 0010000011 by 1110
Gnasrs. Theophilus, who asserta that he has “embraced the na·
ture of glass,” subsequent tobis visit to St. Sophia, and his admir-
ation 01 the effect produced by the different hues thrown upon
the chancel, is the first practical author who enters minutely into a
description 01 the processes of the glass painter, and, as a prac-
tical artist, is the more worthy of our serious attention. The
art of enamelling glass was then lrnorm 10 the Byzantina Greeksr
the statement of the historiari of the monastery 01 St. Begnine is,
therefore, most credible, although attached hythe later French
writers in order 10 support their pratensions, and the opinion 01
the Benedictines, that pictorial representation upon glass dates
from the period of Charlemagne, is supported. The art of pro·
ducing apicture hy means of gradation of shadow, thereby forming
combinatione of light, shade, and colour with the plate of 0101001101
anamelled glass subjected to this process, 0001110 first and great
step 1011011 in the artos glass painting. lt is the process of Theo· ‚
philus, 0110, however, appears 10 bave entertained the idea of paint-
ing objecta upon glass with coloured fluxas, iu imitation of the
ornaments upon vases and cups.

That this process 000 more cong'euial 10 the productiori 01 ex·
00110000 10 window work thau any other, the remains 01 church
windows, executed from the beginning 01 the eleventh tutha end 01
the listeeuth century, are iu evidence to attest.

Reasons for this are not wanting; they have lately been brought
1010011101111 great happiness by tbe later writers upon the art, and
who attempt to prove thatin order 10 return to the excellence
shown at the periods above referred to, the same simplicity of
shadows and hreadth and purity of colour must be returned 10.

The care of the painters of these later periods in the taste and
purity of outline is another cause of the excellence of their 001110.
Outline and arrangement of colour were the points to which all

other consideratione properly yielded, in this mode of decoration,
viewed by the means of transmitted light alone3 which trans·
