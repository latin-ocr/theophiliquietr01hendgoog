shall have dried this over the embers, you will gild the places
one by one without water, being gilt, you will wash it, and
polished, you will colour it. Thon with fiuely pulverized
chamom, and with pieces 01 wood, larger and smaller, you
will rub it carehrlly until it be equally bright everywhere.
Yon afterwards make the fine lines, both on the ⁴gold and
on the silver, which in the making you likewise polish, until you
bring it to perfectiori. When you wish to affix these gold or
silver plates fully relieved and polished, take wax and melt it
in an earthenware or copper rossel, and min tile, finely ground,
with it, or sand, so that there may be two parts 01 this and a
third 01 wax. When this has been likewise melted, you
will strongly stir it with a wooden spoon, and fill up all the
figures with it in gold, silver, or copper, or whatever may
have been relieved in these, and eold, you will attach it where
you wish. Also in copper platee, thinned in the same manner,
the like work is made, but with greater attention and care 11

been brought to the line lines, it should be cleaned on the
outside part with a woollen cloth and saud, until the black
eoat be taken off, and so be gilt and polished, and the draw- ·

ings being finished, be coloured and filled with the above
mentioned composition.
