Csrsrnn, which is water hardened into icc, and the ice of great
age is hardened into stone, is trimmed and polished in this
manner. Take the composition which is called tenax, ol
which mention is made above, and applying it to the lire
until it liquefy, yon will fasten the crystnl to along nond,
which must be similar to it in thickness. When this has be·
come cold, you will rub it with both hands upon a hard sand-
stone, water being added, until it takes the form which you
wish to give it, then upon another stone of the same kind,
which must be liner and smoother, until it be made quite
