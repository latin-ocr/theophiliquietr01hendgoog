No. 2527), belongs to the twelfth‚ or, at latest, to the
very commencement of the thirteenth century3 the
other (No. 11236) is but a copy, but made from an-
other manuscript than our own3 it is of the seventeenth
century, and is upon paper.''

“The ancient manuscript is defective: it commences
by the three prologues of the three books, the index of
chapters oi the first book follows. The rubrio of the
first chapter stands, De temperamento cetorum in node
corporibtc, the last, the thirty-eighth‚ Quomodo colores
in tibris temperentur. The second book contains thirty·
five chapters, of which the title of the first is, Dc con·
strictione fitrni cd manducandam the last, Dc anu·
lic. The third hook contains seventy-eight chapters3
the first, De constructionescbrt‘coe, the last, De orgcnt'sr
hut, asI have said, some leaves are wanting at the end.”

“The other MS„ the modern copy, gives also the
prologoe of each book, and then the index; the first
Δ book contains fortytwo chapters, viz„ De temperamento

colorans, dre, the last, De ceroto. The second hook is
composed of thirty-five chapters, conformable in every
thing tc the other MS.; and the third book contains
seventy-six chapters, via, De cothrttctione fabrice:
the last, De organis, and finishes ‘c plectro cutem inse·
rius omnes unius menoare et pmdcm proasitodinis cont.
Finem

It will be seen that the more modern manuscript is
similar to that at Wolfenbiittel‚ which is deficient in
the C. xl. L. 1. Demaeneto, contained hythe Harleian
and the Cambridge University MSS.

Dr. Wolf thus replies to my demand respecting the
four missing chapters in the second book, which yet
form a part of the index.
