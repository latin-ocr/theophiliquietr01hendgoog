Aurelius, has given a singular recipe fors “drying oil’' sor the
time in which he wrote, although not intended ss such:¹
‘⁶ Oleum vetus, quantum mittendum fuerit pro modo specierum

suprascriptarum, mittes in ollam novam, et calefacies leni flamma 1
vel potius igne, tunc mittes, sed paulatim et manu inspergens, ¹

lythargyrum bene tritum, et assidue spathomela agitabis, postea
aut picem brutiam tritam mittes,”² dc.

ln describing the methodos painting on wood or stone, Eraclius
directa that the wood or stone be well dried in the sun orat the

lire; alter this, white oil colour is to be painted over it two or three f

times with a flat brush; afterwards it is to be primed with the
hand or brush witb a thick white nil paint ; tbis, when half dry, is
to be smoothed with the hand, until all is as smootli ss gloss: he
adds, ‘⁸ yon can theu paint upon it with all colours distempered with

distemperatis pingere.” Nothing ean be clearer than this3 and
that pictorial or other ornamenta! work is intended, is evidentior

Theophilus, however, who professes to teacb “ all that Greece
knew inthe artos pointing,” ends all doubt upon the subject os the
employment of “oil colours” for pictures in his twenty-aiath
chapter. Upon evernished ground of tin leaf fixed upon wood he
directs—“ Tske the colours which you wish to lay on, grinding
theru carefully in linseed oil, without water, and make the tints of

countenances and draperies, ss you have done above, with matera ᾗ
and you will vary with their colours beasts, birds, or leaves, as it y

may please you.'' The reluctance to 'part witha long received
impression must therefore be set aside: and it must be allowed that
the Greeks certainly, most probably the Egyptians, knew the ad·
vantage of oil ss a vehicle for pigments.

ln the MS. from Mouot Athos s recipe ior preparing a drying
oil is given. The oil intended is most likely linseed, hut 1 have
