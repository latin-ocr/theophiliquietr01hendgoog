in this same piece of wood that it may adhere ; 3ηά taking n
small hammer strike lightly in the middle of the knub in one

the hollow. And when by thus persevering you have arrived
at the very middle of the knob,tum it round and do similarly
upon the other side. When you have transpierced this, beat

with water, place it in the opening aud file with the copper.
When you have somevrhat' dilated the opening, beat another
