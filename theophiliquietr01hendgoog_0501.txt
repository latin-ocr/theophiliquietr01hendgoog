“ It had asmall cup to receive the precious liquid which might
fall through accident, from which, in such case, it would fall back
intu the chalice by two small tubes. The instrument was some·
times fixed to the chalice.''

The reed was unknown to the Greeks.

‘⁸ They break many small pieces ol the consecrated bresd, which
they place in the chalice. They have a small spoon with which
the priest takes one ol these small pieces dipped in the wine, and he
thus gives it to the communicante. It is only to the priests and
clerks assisting at the Liturgy that they give the chalice. The
Greeks assert that St. John chrysostome established the uscos
this spoon, but there is no certain prool‘ amongst the ecclesiastical
writers. According to tbe legend it wss thus, that about the year

When the smile, excited by the language of those who followed l
the sacred science, “temps ιιρα,” or chemistry, shall have =
passed, we shall probably bs anxious to search luto the meaning r

of our author.

The Egyptians, according to all authorities, practised the science
at a remote period, and it was in their schools that the Greeks and
Arabs were initiated into the sacred sciente, the revelation os the
mysteries ol which was, at one time, punished by death.

Theophilus, who informs us that “the skill'ulness of the Gentiles
in this art is probable,” is doubtless alluding to the Arab alche-

mistros Spain, who at an early period pursued the sciences ac-
quired from the Greeks and Egyptians.

The process which Theophilus describes in this symbolis lan· ἦ

guage, appears no other than that for procuring a pure gold by the
means of the mineral acids. Let a solution of gold be made by
nitro-muriatic acid and copper be introduced, the latter would be
dissolved while the gold would re·appear‚ but in a state ol purity,
