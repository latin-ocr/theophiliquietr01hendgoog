Peter os St. Audemar 'writes ol solium, “ De solia quomodo
distemperatur.” “ Purpureus color quem lolium vocant laici, qui
lanam iude tingunt, vel potius Anglici‚ inquorum terra conficitur,
‘neormam’ vocant, non uno semper modo distemperatur. Nam
aliqui cum urina, vel lexivia de cinere humiliante, ut in parieti-
bus praecipue, alii in pergamenis cum visco de caseo, ita facto.’'
Thia identifies the solium of St. Audemar with our “madder‚''
which was called “ norma, nuorma or gorma,” in Celtic. This
allusion to our country at so early a period innota little curicus
in the history of the arta. The action ol the acid or alkeline sub-
stances with which these vegetable purpleslor bluea were mixed
would'of course influence their colour.

The “ morella‚’' was a species of ‘⁴ solanum ’⁹ hearing a darlr
berry or seed. The tumsol was used for making a'violst colour,
the fruit of the mulberry tres, the elderhmry, the petals os the
violet and many vegetable colours which must have been very little
permanent even in illuminated books.

Varantia, Warancit, Waranta or Garance, our Madder‚ was
likewise employed by the ancients.

Dioscorides uses the same term for madder which the Greeks

of the present day employ, ipvlpoiam. The “rubia tinctorum” ol
the Romans and the rubia major of the medioeval chemists, in
order to distinguish it from the rubia minor, or bugloss, oi the
alkanet, or anchusa species.

The ¹⁸ Hysginuns'’ os Vitruvius, which has been confouuded by
his commentatore¹ with vaccinium (violet) and hyacinthum, (darlt
purple) is the “ alga tinctoria’' or “ lichen rocelle’' of the moderna,
the ‘oraeille' of the French.'’ Hysginum srorn days, is without
doubt the π aaaaa φῦκος ns Theophrastus², who tells us that it grona
under the rocks in the laland of Crete, and that it is used to dyc
