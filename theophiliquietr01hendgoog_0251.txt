“The mode of introducing a salt into the colour with which
¹ glass is painted’ is perhaps worth remark, The pigments were
ground with wine or utine, an addition of salt to the flux was thus
obtained, in the shape os either the alkaline phosphates, or the
tartrate of potash.”

The recommendation ol Theophilus to avoid the introduction os
yellow glass in windows, unless in ornaments, or where gold is
placed in paintings, is worthy of remark3 the unpleasant and hot
appearance os many of our modern specimens attest the valae
os the recommendation.¹ The French artists have noticed this
effect; they also observa that such s custom it abused “ fait trou'’
in the composition.

At an epoch when the painters and other artists, employed in
the decoration of sacred edifices, were either belonging to, or
under the influence of the church‚ the laws of religious icono-
graphy were faithfully observed3 the nimbus or glory‚ by which the
heads oi Divine, or sainted, personages were surrounded, was em·
blematical of the sacred character. M. Didron‚ in the ‘⁴ Iceno-
graphie Chretienoe,” informs us that when a figure is without the
nimbus, it may certainly be said that itis no representation of a
saint.

Α more sacred character still was given to the Divinity, the
Angels and Apostles3 these were alone represented with the fect
uncovered. Neither the Virgin nor other saints were thus repre-
sented at this epoch.

Every figure with the nimbus is a saint, every saint with nude
ieet is at the least an apostle3 every ligure with animbns orna·
