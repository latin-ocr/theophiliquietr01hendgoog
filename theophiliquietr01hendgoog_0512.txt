calcination (in a cioae veeael iitted with an upper chamber) of
braae or of uelamine, appears to have been the white sulphur of
the Byzantinos and Araba. Both these substancen generally con·
tained arsenio, the volatiliaation os which, with that of the aine,
would produce a mixture of the oxidee of arsenio and ainc3 the
deposition in the lower chamber, of a darker colour und lena pure,
were combinatione os the ainc with other substancee, accord·
ing to the nature of the ore calamine employed. and wne called
spodium ¹.

Geber teile ur that ‘⁴ araenic ia compoeed of auhtle matter, und ia
of the nature of auiphur; it i fred by the metuis, like sulphur, and
like it ie produced hy the calcination of the metaia :” (ia not thiu
the white sulphur of the Greeks i) ‘⁴ Therefore it ia not proper to
be claaoed (diffiniri) otherwise than sulphur.”²

Albertua Magnus, whoae writiuga ure in great measure a rc-
rumc of the Greek and Arab chemiata, tells ue that brana will
yield areeni03 “ me expirabit arsenicum.”³

The hio λιῢιω, white sulphur, waa that which produced white
hraaa: Olympiodorue knew that arsenio gave a white coiour to
copper‚ and he callo it a kind cy* sulphur which ia volatilired hythe
action of fire. MS. 2250, Bib. Ropale, Por.

Richarduc Anglicua, who appears to have been contemporaneoua
with Roget Bacon‚ telle uo that “white sulphur fixea (coagulat)
quickeilver ;” headda that ‘⁴ there ia no sulphur in eilver hut the
white sulphur.”⁴

An impure mixture oi* oxide of areenic with aino or tin, would,
mixed with white glane, yield an opaque flux, proper for pointing
on earthenware.
