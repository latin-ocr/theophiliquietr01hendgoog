blow with the bellows and the mouth until you see this solder
run everywhere as if water were poured over it. And irn-
’ mediately sprinkle it slightly with water, and take it out, and
you will carefully wash it, and again anoint the solder, and
will solder it aa before until all the wires hold lirmly.

CHAPTER LIII.

ΟΡ APPLYING THE GEMS AND Paeana.

Arrnnwnnns cut these in pieccs like straps, so that every
band may have a wire, which you will bend together, and
make small settings of them, by which the stenes may bc en·
closed, large and small, to the size of each one, and you will
arrange them in their places. You will also have flour of
wheat or rye‚ which you will mix with water ln a small
cup, and place over the coals, that it may become a little
warm ; in this you dip these settings slightly, one by one,
each in the lower part, and so fix them in their place. All
being made fast, place the piene of gold upon which you have
lastened them over the coals until the moisture of thedom
is dried, and they will soon adhere. 'lake alno the fine wire
and beat it slightly upon the auvil, so that it may be rather
thin, and yet that the beads above and below may not pro-
ject nor lose their form: with them you will weave flowers,
large and small, with thch you will fill up all the grounds be-
tween the settings; when you have formed these with the fine
pincers dip them into the wet flonr, and you will thus put each
in its place. Which being done, place it over the coals that
it may become dry, and immediately anoInt the soldering and
solder it as above. Both picces of one handle being soldered
and made firm, join them together, and place a foundation to

them around them near their inner edge, namely, a thin piece

of gold, which may be like a straw, and smooth everywhere.

When you have joined which piece between the two, bend

three small thin pieces of iron, and make small stays which
