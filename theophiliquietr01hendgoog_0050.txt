In the accounts handed down to us, Van Eyck is de·
scribed es a clever chemist and it is stated that he was
continually consulting works upon thet science for in-
formation. The works of the Arab chemists had be·
come known: Albertus Magnus, Roger Bucen, Arnold
of Villa Nova, Raymond bully, had all lived end written
upon the “Magnum Opus‚” the basis of which rested
upon sublimation end distillation, by means of which
the elixir, spirit, Ι or excellence of all things were to be
extracted. The words of Lomento, which we have
quoted above, would therefore probably bear a literal

Leonardo da Vinci is stated to heve followed the

manner of colouring invented by John of Bruges, ond
‘to have thinned his oil by means of elembics. - This, I
was convinced‚ intended, that Leonordo distilled the oil
(he himself mentions walnut oil) for the purpose of

of umber in powder, bernrteen gltcpuloirt ,· (a loet is half en ounce,)
ond 1 pound litharge‚ epigellars. The amber is dissolved witha
little oil over the fire3 when dissolved, the oil ie added hot by
degrees; the litharge, of which an enormous quantity is added, is
then put in; it is cooked a little, and is finished. There were

, various modes of making this varnish practised in ltaly at a later

period. The process here described would make a very dark
varnish, which would require to be thinned with walnut or other
oil for use.
