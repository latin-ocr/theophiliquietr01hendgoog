C. Xlll. ANl) C. XlV. “VlTllUM CLARISSIMUM, VELUT
CRYSTALLUM, QUOD lPSl COMPONUNT.”

The “very clear glass like crystal” used by the Greeks, in
order to attach gold leas to vasca, and which in C. xiv. is employed
upon an ornament 01 gold, or silver, previously laid upon glans, it
no other than a flux capable 01 retaining and combining, by the
action 01 lire, with the various vitreous colouring substances aster-
wards supcrposed. This last chapter indeed proves that the
Byzantine Greeks practised the art 01 Parurnro urort Gnass, au
art which all the F rench writers, from Le Viel to M. E. Thibaud,
with perhaps 0 laudable partiality, labour to prove 01 French
origin, andos the twelith or thirteenth century.

Emeric Darid¹ indeed, in exception, mentions tbat the historiari
01 the monastery 01 St. Begnine, who wrote about 1052, declares

that there existed, yet in hir time, in the church 01 the monastery,
every ancient glass window, representing the martyrdom 01 St.

Paschasie, and that this painting had been taken stom the old
church, restored by Charles the Bald, (s. 0. 860,) “ 00 eurum
vtrnas surrourrirs rucrr, et usque ad nostra perdurans tempora,
eleganti praemonstrabat picturd.”

The Benedictines have ascribed this invention to the period 01
Charlemagne, T. 6, p. 66, and with more reason. For Theo·
philus not only describes the ornamenting 01 cups, vasca, and
other utensils, by means 01 coloured glass fluxed upon 0 white
ground; butio C. 21 are found clear directions for paiutiug upon
glass. “ In the same manner you make grounds 01 the clearest
white, the ligures 01 which grounds you ornament with sapphiro,
green, purple, and red.” The dark colour is to take the place 01
posc in marking the nude, &c

Traces 01 0 flux sor the purpose 01 ornamenting 00000, whether

01 glass or earthenware, are found scattered through the books 01
Eraclius. The art of rendering glass ruore fusible by means 01
litharge was well known to that writer.
