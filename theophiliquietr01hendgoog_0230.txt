Gnsnvs ol sand (or silica,) and natron (or the carbonates ol potash
and coda) having been known from the earliest period, it is pro·
bable that the origin ol glaas would date Itoni the highest auti·
qurty.

The Egyptians had at a remote period heated these alkalins
silicates in contact with the metallic oxides, at Thebes and Mem·
phis, and in their temple of ‘⁸ Ptha ” or Fire, devoted to the prac-
tice of their occult chemical arts ¹.

“I have often found in theruins of ancient cities of the
thebudss’ writes M. Roaiere, ‘⁴ amongst the fragments os coloured
glass with which they abound, some pieces tinted with various
colours. Many of them, affording in some os their parts, beautiful
tinto of purple, were, I think, remains of the ancient artificia!
‘⁸ vasa murrhina '’—irits, glasses, enamels, are also found, coloured
by metallic oxides ².

The Phoenicians having traded in the glass ol Thebes, became
themselves famous in the art ot* its manufacture. The tale of the
fortuitous discovery of glass by them, related by Pliny ³, and Ire-
quently quoted, is stated by Merret, upon the authority oi the
most experienced‚ to be impossible, as even by the most violent
lire glass cannot be made, in any quantity, by burning substances,
fit sor its composition, in the open air.
