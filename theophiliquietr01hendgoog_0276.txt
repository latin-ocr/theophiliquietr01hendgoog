gards the wells, there is the appearance of paradise3 if
it marks the ahundance of light from the windows, it
admires the inestimable heauty of the glass and the
variety of the most costly work. But il perchance a
faithful mind should behold a representation of our
Lord's passion expressed in drawing, it is penetrated
with compunction3 if it beholds how many sufferings
the saints hare bodily supported, and how many re-
wards of eternel life they have received, it quickly
induces the observante of a better life3 if it regards
how much rejoicing is in heaven, and how much suffer·
ing iu the flames of hell, it is animated by hope forits
good actions, and is struck with fear hythe considera·
tion of its sins.

Aet therefore now, well-intentioned man, happy he·
iore God and meu in this life, heppier in a future, in
whose labour and stndy so many sacrifices are offered
up to God ; henceforth warm thyseli witha more ample
invention, hasten to complete with all the study of thy
mind those things which are still wanting among the
utensile of the house of the Lord, without which the
divine mysteries and the services of ceremonies cannot
continue. These are the chalices, candelabra, incense
burners, vials, pitchers, caskets of sacred relies, crosses,
missale and other things which useful necessity requires
lor the use of the ecclesiastical order.

If you wish to fabricate these, in this order you
commence.
