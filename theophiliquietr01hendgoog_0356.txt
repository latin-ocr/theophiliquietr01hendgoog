and the breadth of a thumb, which handle will hare a lion's
head at the extremity, cast and properly sculptured, which
head will hold the small basin in his mouth. It will also
hare at the other end a head carved in a similar manner, in
the mouth of which a ring will hang, by means of which it
can bc carried, the finger being inserted. The remainder of
tha handle between the two heads should be decorated in
places with niello, and in places be ornamented with molten
and point work and letters of verses in their places. The
small cup, which is nt the extremity, should be perforated at
bottom in the contre, of the size of two fingers in clrcumfer·
enee, with very fine holes, through which the wine and the
water to be placed in the chalice should run, by means of
which the sacrament of the Lord’s blood is accomplished.

CHAPTER LVIII.

ΟΡ THE VIAL.

Bur if you wish to make the rial for pouring out the wine,
beat the silver in the same manner as the knot of the font of
the chalice is beaten, excepting that the body of the vial
should be formed much wider, and its neck be narrowed upon
along and slender anvil with the moderate-sized homed and
iron hammer. Sometimes also the viaI, when its formation
has commenced, may be filled with wax, and be lightly struck
with the middling iton hammer, that the roundness of the
body and the shape of the neck may be more properly and
evenly trimmed. And thus, the wax being taken ont, it may
again be re-heated upon the coals, and the wax again be put
in, and it may be beaten as before until it is altogether formed.
Which being done, if you wish to make upon the rial figures,
or animale, or flowers in beaten work, first compose the mlx-
ture of pitch and wax and tile.
