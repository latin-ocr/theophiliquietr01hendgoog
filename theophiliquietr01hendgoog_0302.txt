wax, and when ithae become cold‚ hold the foot iteels
in the lest hand, and in the right an iron, yielding and thin,
and make the boy eit near you, who can strike with a very
small hammer upon the iron in whatever spot you place it,
and you will mark the ring with it, which should be around
it between the knot and the foot. Being designed, pour
out the wax, and the foot being warmed fill it again, eo that
yon may hammer the ring more deeply than before; and act
thus until you perfect it equally, with its beade. Then file
aad serape the knot, and around the loot inside and out, and
ltebrim3 and make, in the middle of the knob, a quadrangular
opening according to the siae ol the projectiora in the upper
rase, aud place in it a thick piece of silver, round, perforated
in the same manner. Make likewiee a ring separately, which
ought to stand between the knob and the vaae abore, of the
same size and kind as that which you had formed under the
knob with the ductile iron, and taking a blunted iron you
will rub it upon a dat stone, then upon cah-wood, ground
charcoal being placed upon it, and with it you will polieh the
vase ineide and out, the kuob and foot and the ring, and you
will thus rub it witha eloth and chalk finely scraped, until
the work be made quite brilliant. These things being thus
accomplished‚ divide the projection of the cup into four, ae sar
as the middle, with a thin lile, and turn it over upon a round
anril, so that it may hang equally, and place the ring upon it,
and the projection in the opening of the knoh, and the small
piecee which are from abore, and holding these with the lert ·
hand hrmly and erenly, and in the right the ductile iron, place
them in the knoh, and cauae it to be beaten with the middle·
rized hammer until you fasten it firmly. Asterwards melt the
adver which you hare ffled and scraped with that which is
left, and atrike out a round flat plate with the compare, aa
lugeas is the height of the chalice from the soot below to
lhe mouth above, and rather more, and beat it hollow within
according to the breadth ol the vase at the top, so that it can
lle erenly upon it. And, if you wish, draw two circles within,
