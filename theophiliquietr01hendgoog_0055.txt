which may help to nourish industry, commerce and art,
and, by tending to inrpress new directions and tastes,

which opposes the progress of the mass of human intel·

In concluding my labours, the kindness of the several
gentlemcn to whom Ι have had occasion to apply,

during the progress of this work, demands my liveliest
recognition.

At Vienna, Dr. Ferdinand Wolf ; at Paris, MM.
Libri, Champollion, and the Count do l’Escalopier
united to forward the views of a stranger with a promp-
titudo honourable to them in the service of literature.

At home, Sir Frederick Madden, Signor Panizzi and
Mr. Eastlake‚ have likewise aided my exertions, by at-
tentions and kindness, which have often, in the midst
of difficulties, encouraged and choered labours which
by the concurrent sympathy of so many cnhghteued
men, I have felt were not pursuod without a prospect
of advantage to the public.
