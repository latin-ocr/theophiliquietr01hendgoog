brought from¹ the East. That found in Germany is not perma-
nent, it is commonly called ‘Lasuasrarm’ and this is the mean
between the Armenian stone, which is friable, and the lapis loculi,
vbich is equal in hardness.”

Theophrastus, c. 71, speaks of asandy cyanus, the “ bergblau''
ol the Germans, our mountain blue.

The “Lusor-stein” or male cyanus, the deep blue lapis
armenus, is most probably the “ Lazur'’ of Theophilus.

The Persian “ Lazoard” hlue, is probably the origin of the term
‘'Laron'' Beckmann states that the Persians are very fond of
ultramarina, but that Persia only produces the blue copper ore,
(tbe mele cyanus,) and that the real lapis lazuli is found in the
mountains of Tartary in Bueharia, extending eustward from the
coeptant

Most of the mediaeval writers have confouuded the lapis la·
ruli, the lapis armenus, blue jasper coloured with carhou'ates and
arreuiates of copper, mountain blue, the one with the other, and
errors have arisen which even now are to be dispelled.

But there were factitious blues used by the ancients in pointing.
Theophrastus tells us that “ the Egyptian Kuanos was factitious,
andthat the historians think worthy of a place in their annals,
the king of Egypt who was the inventor of the artificia! cyanus.”²

It was the wrong translation of the second sentence in this chapter
by Hill, which led to his confusion and his wrongful denunciation
of Pliny. “There are three kinds of Cyanus,'' H ill bas trans*
lated ‘⁴ there are three kinds of rtis? which he thus makes rela-

tire to the ‘¹ factitious” Egyptian kind just before mentioned.
Pliny avoids this error, yet mentions, like Theophrastus, all the
kinds together. The “ Caerulea” of Pliny are all factitious kinds³,
which Sir H. Davy thinks preparations of blue carbonates and
arseuiates of copper.''⁴ Vitruvius, however, gives the composi-
tion of the Egyptian blue. “ Arena cum natri (or nitri) flore con-
teritur, adeo subtiliter ut efficiatur quemadmodum farina, et aeri
Cyprio limis,” &e.; the different MSS. have both “nutri'' and
“nitri'' Thus saud, carbonata of soda, to form the gloss, and
tte colouring matter copper lilingo, were the component parts of
