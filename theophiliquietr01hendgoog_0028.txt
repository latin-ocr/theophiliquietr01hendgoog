The ninth century, however, offers the importent fact,
in the history of the arts, of the invention or introduction
oiPeintinguponGlass The Benedictinea have remerked
upon this fact, aud attribute the period, with every proha
bility‚tothe reign of Charlemngue, who died in814¹. The
art itselfis probably of Byzantina origin, ue the flux for
colouring a plate or vessel of glass was known to the
Greeks, who were much employed in the manufacture ol
the coloured and gilt glaes mosaic work, as we shall pra-
sently see. A. fect is mentioned in tha chronicles of
the historiari of the monastery oi St. Benignus, at Dijon‚
who wrote about the year 1052& He states “that
there¹ existed yet in hia time a very ancient glass window,
in the chureh of the monastery, representing the mar-
tyrdom of St. Paschasie, and that this painting had
been taken from the old church restored by Charles
the Bald.'’³ The reasoniug appears inconclusive by
which David seeks to limit the invention to the reign
of this later monarch, as such poete, who heve at all
alluded to coloured glass as used in windows, have so
cursorily noticed it, that it is sometimes even difficult
to determine their meaniug3 thoart was neither neces·
aarily, nor would it be even probably, included in their
descriptione, which relate to the effect produced by the
light transmitted through the coloured medinm ⁴.
