C. LXXXI. “DE ORGANIS.'’

lt will be seen that the Harleian MS. of Theophilus entiches
the archaeologist with three new chapters upon the construction of
the orgen, which seems in the time of our author to have been os a
simple construction.

David, in the cl. Psalm, speaks of the orgen, which does not
appear to have become known to Western Europe until the year
757, when one was sent as a present to Pepin·le·Bref, hythe Ern-
peror Constantine copronymos.

Iu a rare Saron manuscriptos the eleventh century‚-Cotton,
Tiberius, B. 6, page 18, is a drawing of the “ suusuamr curn fis·
tuln aerea,” with brass pipe; also another description of “brasc
bumbula, with the pipes placed in the middle, three bumbula
placed on every side.” This Buunncurr appears to be an orgen,
which is sounded by withdrawing the stopa, being, as the organo
os Theophilus, unsurnished with heys. The pipes are of very
thin and pure coppcr.

In a notice of the “Church oi the Holy Cross,'’ at Binstead, lsle
of Wight, by Mr. Withers-<Weale’s Quarterly Papers on Archi-
tecture, Midsummer, 1845) which church is os early Normsn erec·
tion, a recess in the wall on the north side of the chancel remains
unexplained, as that gentleman states that no traces exist on the
ontside wall to show that a sacristy has ever existed there. simi·
lar recenses are found in our early Norman churches elsewhere,

one in the church at Beaulicu‚ Hampshire, if l am not mistaken.
A probablc solution of the use to which these recenses were ap·

plied is found in the 88 C. ⁴⁴ Si volueris organa ultra maceriam
muri stabilire, itaut infra'rnonastcrium nihil appareat‚” &c They
were for the purpose of a proper arrangement of the organ and the
seat of the organist, at that time the chauter also.
