the above manner, and when you have blown according to
the quantity you wish, you must not make an opening at the
end, as before, but you will datach it from the tube, entire aa

tube, named, adhere to the bottom itself. Raising the vase,
warm it in the flamc, and you will dilate that opening,
whence you separated the tube, with the round piece os
wood, according to your desire3 you will also eularge the
bottom around the tube so that the lower part may be hollow.
But if you wish to make handles to it, by which it may hang,
take athin piece of iron, and, immersing it in the pot of glass,
when a little has stuck to it, raising it, place it upon the vase,
in whatever place it may please you3 and when it has adhered,
heat it, so that it may susten firmly. Make os these handles
what you pleasc, in the mean time keeping the vase near the
flama, so that it may be hot, yet not liquefy. Take also a
little glass from the furnace, so that it may draw a thread
after it, and placing it upon the vase in what place you wish,
revolve it near the fleme, that it may adhere. Which being .
done, you will remove the tube according to custom, placing
the vase in the cooling oven; and you will work in this

fashion as much as you desire.
