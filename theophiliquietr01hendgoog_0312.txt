applied, carefully cover it, and you will blow gently with a
long hreath until the soldering is sufficiently melted; with·
drawing the vase from the fire, and eooling it slightly, you
will wash it, and, if the nails are firm, it is well ; but if not,
do again to them as before. And when they have become
firm, lile them off inside and serape them smoothly, that no
one may be ableto see in what place they have stood, and
the handles being set on outside‚ again carefully join them on.
Thea make through the middle of the handles against the
nails very fine hollows‚ and likewise in the same place beyond
the nails, into which you fix them with all perfeeted labour,
so that no one may perceiwe how they adhere. After these
things sculpture and grave these handles studiously with illes
and iron instrumente, and it you wish to blacken anything in
them, act in this manner.

ol it and beat it square, long and slender. Then take the
handle with the pincers 3ηά heat it in the lire until it glosas,
and with another forceps, long and thiu, hold the niello and
rub it over all the places which you wish to make black until
all the drawings are lull, and carrying it away from the lire
carelirlly make it smooth with ellat file until the silrer sp·
pear, so that you can scarcely observe the traits‚ and, so
serape it with the cutting iron, earelully cut away the ine*
qualities, 3ηά you will gild what remains. Which gilding you
