CHAPTER LIX.

OF THE commulrrow walen IS cauum) ΤΕΝΔΧ.

Garun a piece of hrick or tile very small, and melt some
pitch in an earthenware pot and add a little wax. These
being melted together, miugle the powder of the tile, and

stir it strongly and pour it into water. And when it has be-
gun to grow cold, dip both hands into the water and mace·
rate it for a long time, until you cau extend and draw out this
composition like a skin. Yon instautly melt this composition
aad will fill the vial to the top. And when it has become
cold, portray in the body and in the neck whatever you wish,
cnd taking slender ductile instrumenta and asmall hammer,
design that which you hare portrayed around it, by striking
ligbtly. Then gire the hammer to the boy, who may sit
opposite you, and hold the rial in your left hand, and the in·
struments in your right, each one in his place; and make
the boy atrike them in what mode you plesse, slightly or
strongly, and depress the grounds that they may become
hollow, and the work be raised. And when you hare beaten
it once throughout, the rial being brought to the fire, eject the
composition, and the rial being reheated and taken from the
bre again, fill it and beatas before, and do thus until you de·
prcss all the grounds equally, and you sashion all the work,
so that it may appear as if cast. Above all arrange that the
silrer of the rial be so thick that when you have formed the
work by bearing, you may be able to chase, hollow, and serape
it properly with the sculping instrumenta Which being ac-
complished, if you wish, make the cast handle in the same
manner as yon formed the handles of the silver chalice, and
the spout where the wine is poured out ; these you will fasten
with solder, made with silver and copper as above. Then
you will ornament with niello wherever you may wish, and
gild the remainder as above.

Yon make in the same manner gold and silver cnps and
plates and boxes for placing the wafers aud incense caskets;
also handles for knives and figures upon crosses and missals
in gold, or silver, or copper.
