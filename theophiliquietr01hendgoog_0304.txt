³ wilh the compass, and portray with a blunted graver the
likeness of a lamb in the middle, or a right hand aa is de-
scending from heaven and blessing, and letters between these
two circles, and hollow it finely with the sculpturing iron,
polishing it effeetirely, as the chalice.

CHAPTER XXVII.

OF THE muana CHALICE AND l'rs MOULD.

Bur if you wisb to construet a large silver chalice, of four, or

six, or ten marks, you will first purify and prove all the silver
in the lire 3 afterwards divide it in the order above. Alter this
take two piceas of iron equally long and wide, ol the measure
os a palrn and thick as a straW, evenly beaten and without
flaw, and carefully smoothed.with aplane: make between
these an iron binding beaten smoothly and moderately
thick, which you will bend iu fashion of a circle, ol such siae

¹ asit may be apparent to you that it can be filled with the

silver whic'h you wish to cast in it. And when you have bent

1 it, do not join the ends together, but you will separate them

alittle that an opening may appear through which you ean
pour in. You will adapt this circle equally between the two
irou (platee), so that its ends may appear a little beyond the
irons, and bind these with three strong iron hooks in three
places, namely, below and on each side near the opening, and
thus plaster beaten clay around the circle between the irons
aad abundantly about the opening. When this mould has
become dry, you worm it and pour in the merted silver. All
gold and silver, which is founded in this manner, is always
sound,(unless it happen through great negligenee,) lor working
in it whatever you may wisb. You will measure the cireles
also according to the quantity which you wish to sound, and
you make larger and smaller: atter yon have beaten out the
melted silver as above, fill it with wax and beat it on the
body, if you wisb to have ribs flat or round3 these stand
around like small spoons, both which kinds of work give .
grem omament to the chalice.
