can beat and thin it with along and slander hammer, if necd-
fil. But if two or three, or more, heads should be iu tha
picture, yon should do about each one as 1 have said, until

the height which you may wish is attained. Thon with
the tracing instrument design the body or bodies of the
figures, and so, by depresaing and sometimes by beating, you
will relieve tham as much aa it may plenae you3 providing
this, however, that the head bs always the most relieved.
Alter these things you will design the nostrils aud eyebrows,
the mouth and ears, the bair, eyes, hands and arms, and the
other shadows of the draperias, the footstools and feet, and
you will raise them inside thus, with tha smallest curred in-
strumenta, above all taking care that it be not broken or per·
lorated. But if through wantos knowledge, or negligence,
this should happen, it should be soldered in this manner.
Takea little of the gold itsels, or silver, and mix with it a third
partos copper, and meltiug them together you will tile it
finely, and wine-stone being burnt and salt added, you will
mix it with water; thinly anointing it with which, spread
the lifing over tha fracture. This dry, again annint the mix-
ture, more thickly, and coals being applied above aud below,
you will blow gently, until you can see the solder flow. Sea-
ing which, immediately sprinkle it with water, and if it be
hard, well; if not, however, do the like again until it has be-
come firm. Should the fracture, however, be broad, carefully
join a small piace cf the same gold or silver, equally thiu, to
it, which you will solder in tha like manner until it adhere
everywhere. And when the relies of the figures shall have
been carried to the point of the chasings, should it be gold,
you immediately make them, and polish caresully, and you ‚
will colour it with ‘⁴ atrament‚''¹ bumt to redness, and salt,
aaabove in the work of the chalice. Should, however, the
picture be silver, and yon should wish upon these figures to
gild the crowm, the hair, beard and portione of the draperr'es,
this should be done before the fine lines are made, in this
manner. Arrange two parts only of clay, finely ground, and
a third of salt, and mix thern together in a small vessel with
