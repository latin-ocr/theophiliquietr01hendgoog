Petrus, ol St. Audenter', gives the rnethod ol making the hest
vermiliou, ‘⁴ vermiculum optimum.” ‘⁴ ll vyou wish to melre the
best vermilion‚ tolie a glasa bottle aud cover it with alute outside3
audtake one part of quichsilver‚ by weight, and two, by weight,
oi white or yellow coloured sulphur. Put it into the above bottis,
which you afterwards place on four stones, and, laying a very
slight lire of ooals round the botrie, cover its mouth with stile,
and when you see the srnolre corne white from the mouth ol the
hottle‚ close it, but when asmolre as red aa the vermilion shall
conte out, take it srorn the lire and you will have the best ver·
nilion.’' Similar recipes are found amongst the medical writers of

the thirteenth and fourteenth century, but are moatly repetitions.
The Greeks called ‘⁴ Dragon’r Blootl,'' κιννάβαρι ’lulium ludiau
cinnabar.

the duration of the heat employed.

zantines. Arsicon or arxica ia like orpiment3 it is a yellow colom,
and by being mixed with the sap ot' the plant called scaldalussa,a
green is made3 aud the sap ol other plants is good for this. Id.

There is no doubt that the “Arxica ” of Cennino Cennini ismae-
sicot, or a prot-oxide ol lead. ‘⁶ Giallo ὲ un colore, che si chiama
