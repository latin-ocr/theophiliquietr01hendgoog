yon may wiab to make in enamel, whether circlee, or knuto,
or small ssowera, or birds, or animala, or figurea; and you will
arrange the small piecea delicately and carefully, each in ita

, place, and will fasten them with moistened flour over tbe

coele. When you have filled one portion, you will eolder it
with the greatest care, that the alender and line gold may not
be diejoined nor liquefy; and do tbua twice or three timeo,
until the separate pieces adhere a little.

All the enamele being composed and soldered in thia man·
ner, take all kinds of glaas which you had prepared for thia
work, and breaking a particle from each piece, place all tbe
v fragments together upon a piece of copper, each piece by
iaelf, and placing it in the lire arrange the coals around and
· abore it, and blowing carelully‚ you will see whether they
melt equally; if ao, use thern all; if however any particle ia
harder (than the rest) place it by iteelf. Taking separate
piecea os the proved glass, place them in the tire one by one,
and when each one has become glowing‚ throw it into a
topper vesael in which there io water, and it inatantly llies
into small fragments, which you break with a round peetle
until made quite fine, and you will thus waeh it and put it
into a clean vessel‚ and you cover it witb a linen cloth. ln
this manner you prepare the separate eolours. Which being
done, take a piece of the soldered gold, and you will fasten it
upon a smooth table with wax in two placeo, and taking a
800oe quill cut to a point, aa is for writing but with a longer
beak and not split, you take out with it one of the colours of
glast, whichever you pleaee¹. That which remeius over,
replace in its small cup and cover it, and do this with each
colour until one piece is filled: taking away the wax, to which
. ithad adhered, place this pieceupon athin iron‚wbicb may bave
ashort handle, and cover it with another iron which is bollow

like a cup, and let it be perforated finely all over, so that the
ll⁰les may be ineide ilat and wide, and outside finer and
