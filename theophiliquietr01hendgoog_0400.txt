borders slender aud wide, in which ean be iloners, animala
and small birds, or dragous linked together by the necks and
tails, and they ure not sculptured too deep1y, but moderately
and carefnlly. You will then thin silver, much more thinly
than ior the relies, of the length you wish, and you will
cleanse it with charcoal, finely pulverized, and acloth ; you
polish it with chalk scraped upon it.

Which being done, affix the silver to any berder, and the
iron being placed upon an anril, so that the engraving may
be uppermost, and the silver lying upon it, place abore it
some thick lead and striks strongly with the hammer, so that
the lead may beat upon the thin silver, into the sculpture, so
strongly, that all the designa may fully appear in it But
should the plats be longer (than the stamp) draw it from place
to place, and, affixed to the iron, hold it evenly with the pin-
cers, aud one part being struck, another can be hammered,
and do thus until all the plats be filled up. 'l'his kind of
work is rather useful, about the borders, in manufacturing
the tables of altars, in pulpita, in easkets for sacred sub-
stances, and in whatever places needful 3 and when the relief
is beautiful and delicate, it is easily done. Work os this kind
is also made in copper, which is thinned in a similar manner,
is cleansed and gilt and polished3 this placed upon the iron,
so that the gilding be turned towards the iron, the lead being

superposed, it is struck until the designa appear. The image

of the crucifixion oi the Lord is also sculptured mironio the ‘

above mentioned manner, of which, when impressed upon
silver or copper, phylacteria are made, that is, coffers of relies
and small shrines of saints. Α sculpture is also made in iron
nithe image of the Lamb of God, and the figures oi the four
evangelista, with which, impressed upon gold or silver, the
cupa of precious wood are ornamented, the circle ol the lamb
standing in the middle of the cup, the four evangelista in
fashion ol a cross around, and with four borders proceeding
from the lamb to the lour evangelists3 ligures of small fish
andos birds and beasts are orade, which are fixed upon the
remaining ground os the cup, affording much ornament.
'l'he image of the Divinity is also made in the same manner,
