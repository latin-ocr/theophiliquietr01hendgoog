Sauum you wish to gild copper with the unctuous substance
oi gall, first serape it with a knife, end then with a bear'e
tooth quielrly polish it; and this being done, paint tbe gull

with apeucil over it, and when it bas become dry, paint it
again and again, and take care that you do not draw tho
peucil moreio one place than another, but that it be equally
covered with the liquor of gall. Let not what l nh you ep-
peer t'alee, who bave proved thie art to be true, and have ln·
veutod it, tho God, whose sonutain is of wiedom, assistiug.

01² THE rumpuntur} OF THE STURGEON’S ausuum.

Sumit the sturgeon's bladder in water until, by bruising it
between the hands, you can make it like a cerate, and theu
place itin very clear water in a pot, and put it to the lire, so
that it may not buil, bnt may receive such beat that, being
liquefieri, it may be eonverted into water. Then etrain it
into a basin through e clean eloth, and leave it in a cold
place that it may have aeoess to the air, that it may coagulate.
When, layingon the linger, you have pressed it, should the
gluten resist, end not be broken by that pressure, melt it at
the five and pour it upon the gold, and work it very hot, with
tow. But should the gluten grow too thielr, admit a little
water and worlr. Should it, however, be too eost, so that it
cannot retain the impression of the finger, eook it better et
the fire, and yon ean easily solten this gluten at the fire and
make it firm. Yon never edd gum to gold or other metals:
for whatever, it being hard, shall be gummed with it, quiekly
falls off, colours being excepted‚ which also will not stand well,
unless they are very well ground together and are very thinly
painted on the books.
