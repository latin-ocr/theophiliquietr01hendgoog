and whose authority is conclusive, states that it is of
that period, and that it is certainly written in Germauy ¹.
It contains 115 folios ol the books of Theophilus, and
five folios oi recipes relating to the arts, written by
another hand of the period. A treatise ‘⁶ De Unguen-
tis '' follows3 it is a collection of medical recipes. The
title and preface to the {irst book are unfortunately
wanting3 iri so voluminous and superior a copy some-
thing might have been otherwise adduced from these
which would have unravelled the mystery which shrouds
the age and country os our author.

That this MS. is likewise hut a copy from an older
work is proved by the variations it presents from the
Vienna and Wolfenhiittel Mss. supplying many omis·
siuns, claiming also the restoration of a few whichI
have carefully noted during the progress of the work.
The four chapters missing in the second hook (see
Iudex, p. 110), have probably been cut from the ori-
ginal, as no lacuna is left hythe scribe in this.

It will be observed upon perusal that the whole of
the work, from C. LXXXI. L. III. p. 345, is new.
It had been hitherto lost3 the promises held out in the
prefaee to the First Book are fulfilled.

The Third Book has evidently been treated by
Theophilus with more care and attachment than the
others. The eloquent preface, the lahour expended in
description, and the great volume oi the work upon
metala attest this. He had proceeded gradually to
describe “all those things which were still wanting
among the utensils of the House of the Lord‚'’² when

¹ Sir Frederick stated to me that it was not impossible that this
MS. was written at the end os the twelsth century.
