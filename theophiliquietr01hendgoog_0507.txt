The difference between “aes ” and “ aurichalcum,” both a braca,
is taught us by Theophilus ς “res” is the mixture ol calamine with
unrelined copper-“ aurichalcum '⁹ is made with very pure supper,
because it can then be gilt. C. 66.

Bell metal is made by adding a finh of tin to melted copper. C.

:Theophilus speaks of Spanish bruas, as used io thin platea iu

stamped work. This, being gilt, is probably a tbin plate of copper
coated with gold by the process described in note to C. 48, p.

C. LXXII. INTERRASILIS OPUS.

Critics have differed as to the interpretation ol this word.
“Quod nunc scripturis nunc planitie variatum hoc, et non aliud,
opus, interrasile dicas.'’—Alex. By this would be intended aa
engraved work, varied with plain surlaces. lt bas been called
“ Auaglypba Scriptura‚’' carved work. Muratori thought that it
applied only to the species of engraving in the manner ol ceals.
“Quo nomine opinor, non omnem caelaturam designari, sed eam
tantum, quae incidendo figuras efformabat, ut estin sigillis.” (V.
2, p. 360.) Theophilus, in designating this as Arabian work, has
caused Emeric David¹ aad M. de l’Escalopier¹ to think that the
word interrasilis means Damascus work, ‘¹ domsrqrdwe,” or the
threaded gold or silver work seen upon the sabres, pistols, cui-
rasses, δια, of the east We fortunately possess a chapter in this
MS. in which this latter art is carefully detailed3 the damascine
work is described in one ol' the chapters hitherto unknown, G. 90.

The opus interrasilis, then, is an engrased or sculptured plate‚
tbe plain grounds of which are cut out with the chisel, ot “meizel,”
in the German. Our ancient English brasses are ol this nature.

C. LXXV. ΟΕ· STAMPED WORK.

This branch of industry has already been followed in France
since the publication of Theophilus by the Couut de l'Escalopier
in 184³. 1 have seen some bold and handsome designa hom
