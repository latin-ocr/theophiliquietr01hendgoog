Peseri is lilrewise, in the same MS„ directed in the preparation

lhave here only quoted from the old part os the manuscript,
the different recipes at the conclusion of the first bools having
been added srom time to time, some of them being as late as the

le coulez et garder tres bien l¹oile‚ et de cette oile gardee et ainsi

lin, de chauvre, ou de noia, et melea avec mine ou sinope sur une
