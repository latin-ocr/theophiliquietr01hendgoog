gest, best it and lay it togethe'r in the pots as before. Aster-
wsrds take a new clay pot snd break a hole iu the bottom,

3 end four (holes) round the sides, und make a small vnsc in

clay, with three feet so separated from ench other that they
cnn stand over the opening which is in the bottom of the pot;
place the vessels with the gold upon this when ithus becorm

ἔ dry, and you will elevate the pot upon three stones some-
* what spart from ench other, and equally thick, and put in

some glowing conls, then some dead (cosle), ond thus ss

2 osten as they are deficient superpose fresh, end never suffer
r the vessels to be destitute of lire. But sometimes stir the
’ coals with s small piece of wood put through the opening,
’ and the like below, that the ashes may come out and the nir

may heve access. And oct with the coals in the eurthen pot
as with the wood in the furnace above.
