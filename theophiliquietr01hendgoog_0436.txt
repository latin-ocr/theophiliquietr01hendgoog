cause, should it he permitted to become cold in it, it would
be swelled out from tlre damp os the earth, and, without
doubt the hell would be crackcd. This being taken ont, the
monld must again be raised upon the ground and may so re-
main, until the outside has become quite cold ; and so the
clay may be broken and the hoops taken away, and what-
ever inequality should be outside, may be cut off with sharp
hammers. Then, in the middle of the bell a block is placed,
similar to that in which the mould was first turned, and four
other pieces of wood are fastened firmly to its edge, so that
the funnel may lie upon one post and this wood upon another,
that, acnrved wood being placed on, the bell can be turned,
and with a sandstone be made smooth everywhere. After·
warde, the sunuel, tiled on every side, is carefully broken, and
about the neck two pieces of wood are joined together, the
lower, smaller one, through the middle, and the npper, larger,
around it 3 which pieces of wood must be bound fast by two
hoops, strongly, and are tied by iron chains about the
handles everywhere. This larger wood should be rather
longer than the bell is wide, arrd be somewhat thinner nt the
ends than in themiddle,and at these ends it must have twothick
and round irons, the length of which, within the wood, may
be a space of half a foot, and beyond it, of one palm. And
when you have fitted two beams for sustaining the bell, malie
two mensures in them two fingens deep, iu which these large
nails can be enclosed, under which you also place two curved
irons for preserving the beams. That larger wood in which
the bell hange must also have, on each side, single hules, in
which tvvo woods projeeting upwards ere placed; to these the
ropes are tied for tolling. A thick leether also, of the stag's
neck may be placed round that curved iron, which rests in-
slde in the middle of the bell, in which the tongue must
hang, which must be of such length that it may protrnde be-
yond the bell lor a space of the width of the band, and let it

be thicker at the end for the length os a palm, and thinner
upwards.
