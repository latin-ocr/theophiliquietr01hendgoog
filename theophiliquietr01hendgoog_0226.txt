slight flame, grinding carefully with water upon the porphyry
stone, and with a pencil paint a thin stroke over the fracture.

that you may hold two parts of the wood in your hand, and
let the wheel remain above your hand firmly fastened to the
wood, and let a third part of the wood show itself above the
wheel. This wood must be cut thiu at the extremity, and be
so joined in an iron, as alance is joined in its pike, and this
iron must have the length ola loot, to which the wood is
joined, so that at the junction it may be even with the wood,
and from this place it may be more slender, diminishing to·
