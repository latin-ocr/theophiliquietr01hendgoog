tendrils facilitate the formation of carbonio aeid, and thus account
for the superiority of the Rhodian ceruael Marble ia now used
for alihe purpose in Holland.

The Byzantine MS. pnblished by Muratori ¹, and which he
refers to the eighth century, gives the same reccipt for making
“ white lead,” ‘⁴ De composition psimitthin.”

Thus, no alteration in the manufacture of white lead had been
attempted l'rom the tirne of Aristotle to that ol our author. L. l.
c. 39. ln tlre MS. Britiah Muaeum, Sloane 1754, cernae ia called
‘¹ Minium Album.” Thia MS. is of tlte early lralf of the four·
teentlr century2.

The use of cernae aa a pigment is confined by Theophilus to
plaster work, nond, or canvaas. Sir H. Davy in his analytia of the
coloura of the ancients³ found that the whitea he examined “were
all fine chalk,'' yet, that Davy did not find white lead used upon a
moral decoration iano proof that it did not enter into the other
decoratione, or picturas, of the Romans, used in encaustic, or with
guma, gluten, or oil upon plaster worlr.

The white lead of the present period ia a combination ol prot-
oxide ol lead with carbonis aoid, and is a sub-carbonate of lead.
It ia prepared, at Cliohy, by forming aprecipitate, with narbonia
aeid gas, in a saturated solution of prot-oxide of lead in distilled
vinegar. The current os carbonic acid gas is passed through this
solution, and tlre precipitata is waahed and dried.

A patent was r‘ecently taken in London for ameana of manu·
facturing white lead by one process from the metal. Very small
ahot was violently agitated in water, by which a pulverulent
hydrated oxide was produced. This, having been exposed to tha
air, became converted into a carbonate.

Had this powder been exposed to the action of narbonia aoid gas
in a close chamber, a fine carbonata os lead would have been pro·
duced fit for the artist3 aa it was, the patent was not much valued, as
two procesaes would have been neeessary during the manufacture.
