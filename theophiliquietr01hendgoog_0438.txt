should begin from the highest, that by descending he may be
ableto arriveat the graver (cymbals). He con likewise note
euch one with its own letter, that he may know itin the par·
tition. In the first place let him mulie two portions of wax
cqual with the balance, one for letter a, the other for o. Let
him divide the wax of lettera into eight equul parts, and
