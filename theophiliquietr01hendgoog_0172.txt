As this chapter immediately follows the mention os colours
ground in oil, and the composition of an oil varnisb, it is more
than probable tbst, considering also the nature of the work, these

ln the reign of Henry ll., (llos-1189) Henry de Blois,
archdeacon ol‘ Both, and chaplain to the king, exclaims against
tbe luxury indulged in by the military men of bis time, and
censores the ostentation of some of these borona: “They carry
thields into the field so richly gilded, that they present the pros-

them back untouched, and, as l may say, in a virgin state. They
timcause both their ahields and saddles to bc painted with the
representatione of battles and equestrian combats, that they may
plesse their imaginatione with the contemplation of soenes in
which they do not choors to engage.”¹

half burnt amumed a red colour.‘'³ Sinopis thus became a gene·
rsl name sor all the red ochreous earths or reddles, the ‘⁸ miltos''
oi the Greeks, and “ rubrica '’ of the Romans.

The Μιλτος of Theophrastus is certainly no other than tho red
ochreous earth or ore which owes its eolour to iron. He gives
tbe different varieties of milton, and tells us that “ the hest camo
