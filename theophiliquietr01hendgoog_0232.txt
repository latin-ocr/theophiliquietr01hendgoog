‘1¹1ss LORT CHAPTBRS·

Chapters xii.. xiii, xiv, xv, of the Harleisn Manuscript‚
ere wanting· They have evidently never formed a part of
this manuscript, as the chapter which forms our No. xii, ‘⁴ Da
Drvrass1s Vrrsr Couoamus now Taausnncrms,” is marked No.
xvi. in the index, and yet is a consecutive chapter in the body oi
the work. They have been abstracted from the original manu·

script, now lost, as it is seen elsewhere that the oldest copy of

Tbeophilus known, that in the Imperial Library at Vienna, also ’

wants them, as do the Wolfenbirttel end Nani MSS. Having the
titles of these chapters in the index it will perhaps be possible to
replace this lacuna with the matter, if not in the words of Theo·
philus, by consulting the preceding or cotemperancous Byzantina
works, in which this subject is discussed.

C· xii. “Of the colours which are made from Copper, Lead, and
Salt.''—c. xiii. “Of Green Glass.”-c. xiv. “ Of Blue Glass.’'-
c. xv. “Of the glass called Gallien.'' These are the titles oi the
missing chapters, and they unfortunately leave a great void in the
history of the art of the period at which Theophilus wrote. It is
not to be doubted that, notwithstanding the resources of the
modern artificer iu the advances and the aid of sciense, some of
the compositions, of material, of the ancients are in vain sought in
our day, although a portion of our glass painters refuse to acknow·
ledge the fact. Where is to be seen in the atelier of t0·day the
finest and peculiar “ blue’' traceable until the end of the filheenth
century? Cobalt will not produce this colour3 or if so, ol what use
is our vaunted advance in chemical science, if it yet remains a pro·
bleml Slrould one novelty be produced from the perusal os the
following extracta, they will have been found worthy the perusal
of the artist, and they will repay the labour of research.

OF GREEN GLASS.

olympiodorus of Alexandria, who wrote at the commencement
os the third century, and a manuscript of whom upon the “ sacred
art’' oi alchemy is in the Bibliotheque Roysle at Paris, No. 2250,
gives us the mode of imitating the emerald.
