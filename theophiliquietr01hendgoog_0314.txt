CHAPTER XXXlll.

ΟΡ namne THE GOLD.

Tarra gold, of whatsoever sort it may be, and beat it until thin
leaves are made in breadth three fingere, and as long as
you can. Then cut outpieces that are equally long and wide,
and join them together equally, and perforate through all with
afine cutting iron. Asterwards take two earthen pots proved
in the lire, of such a siae that the gold can lie flat in thern,
and break a tile very small, or clay of the fumace bnmed and

ῑ red, weigh it, powdered, into two equal parts, and add to it a

third part salt for the same weight ; which things being slightly
sprinkled with urine,are mixed together so that theymaynotad·
here together, but are scarcely wetted,and put a little of it upon
a pot about the breadth of the gold, then a piace of the gold

3 itself, and again the composition, and again the gold, which
¹ inthe digestion is thus always covered, that gold may not be

in contact with gold, and thus fill the pot to the top, aud
cover it above with another pot, which you carefully rute
round with clay, mixed and beaten, and you place it over the
lire, that it may be dried. ln the meantime compone a fur-
nace from stanes and clay, two feet in height, and a soor and
ahalf in breadth, wide at the bottom, but narrow at the top,
where there isan opening in the middle, in which project
three long and hard stenen, which may be able to sustain the
flama for a long time, upon which you place the pots with
the gold, and cover them with other tiles in abundance. Then
supply tire and wood, and take care that a copious fire is not
wanting for the space of a day and night. ln the morning,
taking out the gold, again melt, beat and place itin the fur·
nare as before. Again also, after a day and night, take it
away, and mining a little copper with it, malt it as before, and
replace it upon the fornace. And when you have taken it
away a third time, wash and dry it carefully, and so wcighing
it, see how much is wanting, then t'otd it up and keep it.
