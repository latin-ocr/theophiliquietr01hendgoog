this was the substance which produced the line and peculiar tints

The Byzantine MS. given by Muratori is silent upon the suh·
ject of a blue glass.

Eraclius informs us, aller having directed the manufacture of a
glass of silica fluxed with lead, ⁸⁶ De isto vitro plumbeo, ille sci·
licet qui coeruleus est, qui de duobus coloribus potest lieri, poteria
si vis curn pulvere saphireo miscere ad pingendum in vitro.”-
“From this lead glass, that one namely which ia blue, which can
be made of two colours, you can mix, if you with, sanentur
powder sor pointing upon glass.”³ Again,

“eoonooo eruemur nr vtrao.”

“Dicendum quo modo pingere debes in vitro. Accipe gros·
sinum de saphiro et palliam quae excutitur de calido ferro super
incudem fabri, cum groecino tertiam partem pones, et plumbeum
vitrum, judicatim scilicet, misces, et super murmurem ferreum
sortiter teres, sicque pingere potest.”

of sternier, and the rust which is suuok from the hot iron
upon the smith’a anvil, you put a third part with the piece (of
sapphire), and you mix lead glast, with judgment, and you grind
it strongly upon an iron slah, and it can thus be painted with.”

Eraclius mentions ‘⁶ Laaur” in a composition for colouring
earthenware vases of a darlr hue 3 this is noticed elsewhere as pro-
bably a preparation from copper or cobalt.
