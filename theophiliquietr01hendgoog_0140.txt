⁸⁸ Take tbe quantity you please of linseerl oil‚plaoe it on the fire
aud boil ituntil upon puttinga pen into thehoiling oil it warps as if
burnt3 and when it is cooked, take it from the fite, and cast pounded
and aifted semix into the said oil, little by little, and remember not
ιο put too much at a time, because it will rise up and swell so as to
run over. And when you have put in all the vernix, replace it for
ashort time upon the fire until it has become slightly hot again,
then strain it and it is done.

⁸⁸ Note-that the best manner ιο make it is, by putting to the said
oil‚ Greek pitch, two parts as much ο1 the resin as there is oil.
And a third way of making it is hy putting to the same oil, when
cooked, as much resin as there is oil‚ and this is according to N i-
colao di Bertold0.”
