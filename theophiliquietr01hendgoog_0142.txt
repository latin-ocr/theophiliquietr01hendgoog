Caneparius, “De Atramentis,” p. 800, writes-

“Ex Vernice‚ (sandaracha Arabum) et oleo ex semine lini,
fit liquida vernix.'’

The two processes given by Theophilus would form, owing to
the peculiar nature of the resin, two different varnishes. By
the first process the resinous portion alone of this gum resin would
be dissolved, unless the boiling were continued sor a very long
tium, so as at last to raise the heat to ahigh degree, in order to
lteep the oil at the cimmeriug point, which becomes higher in pro-
portion to the loss of tha more volatile portione of the oil, which
it will he remembered are allowed to escape, “until a third part
isconsumed.'' The varnish, however, is not perfected by the first
process, and is ol a very darlt colour. By the second process the
whole os the resin may be incorporated with the oil at once and the
long boiling is not required, nor does Theophilus prescribe it.
The word “bullire‚” is used by our author in opposition to
“coquere'’ the latter having the signification os “to seeth,’'
the former ‘⁶ to boil violently,'’ as “aestuo ” “ferveo’' against the
danger of which he'cautions the artist.

The true Arabian sandarac is stated hy Schoushoe ¹, aDenish
traveller, to be produced by the thuia articulata, which is acy·
presa. lt is called “el grassa.” The juniper cypress does not
grow in Africa Dr. Ure gives an analysis of this gum-resin.
“Spec. gr. l.05 to 1.09. It contains three resins, one soluble in
alcohol, somewhat resembling pinio aeid or turpentine resin, one
not soluble in that liquid, and a third soluble only in alcohol of
90 per cent.''

These varnishes are of the twelfth century.
