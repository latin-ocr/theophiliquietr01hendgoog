boare tooth, upon a flat wooden tablet, until they become
shining.

to another, end attach thern singly to the wood with wax, so
that they cannot be moved, end superpose with your hand
the before-mentioned vernish gluten, end you will dry them
in the sun. Alterwerde take sticks of rotten wood, which
you cut in April, eplit them through the middle, ond dry
them in the smoke. Then take off the outer burk, and scrupe
the inner, which is yellow, into a clean vessel, adding to it e
fifth pert saffr0n3 and pour over this a quantity of old wine,
or beer, end when it hes thus stood e night, on the morrow
warm it upon the lire until it liquely ¹, end eo place in it the
tin leaves one hy one, and litt them up frequently, until you
are of opinion that they show the golden colour sufficiently.
Alterwnrds you will again attach them to the wooden tablet,
vernishing them over with gluten as before, end when they
ure dry, you have ready tin leaves, which you may place upon

your work according to your wish with shin-glue. And then
take the colours which you wish to lay on, grinding theru
caresully with linseed oil, without water, end make tints ior
faces, and for draperiee, ee you before made with water, and
you will vary beests, or birds, or leaves, in their coloure, ee it
may pleuse you.
