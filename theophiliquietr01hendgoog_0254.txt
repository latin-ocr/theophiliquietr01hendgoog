sorus ro soor 11. 185

Dutens states that during the excavations st Pompeii in 1778,
the windowa of some chambers, attached to the batha, were iound
glared with as fine glaas aa that of the moderna. Bacuntius¹ and

· St. Jerome², writers os the third and fourth centuries, both speak
of glazed windowa. The employment ol coloured glass arranged
in Mosaic fsshion, the “fenestra simplex,” c. 29 os Theophilus,
would soon gire place to the uae ot' painted glast ss the srt ad·
vanced. Observant of the effecta os colour productive of such
admiration during the early efforts of art, new exertions, in order
to unita the beauty of pictorial effect with the previous ricbnesa of
decoration, would doubtless soon be rnade to call to aid the talenta
os the Christian artiat. “

ln the aixth century, when Fortunatus oi Poitlere³ lauda tha
biahops who ornameuted their churches with large windowa of
gloss, and the effect which they produced by the ruys ot' the sun;
he, by thia, evidently intends s coloured glast.

Sidonius Apollinaria⁴, in his letter to Hesperius, speaks positively
os coloured gloss having been used in the windowa of the church
created by Patiens, at Lyona.

Fortunatus and Paul the hermit, as well as Theophilus, de·
scribe the admirable effect which the rising sun produced through
the windows oi St. Sophia at Constantinople. (See Preface to this
Book, p. 117.)

lt is more than probahle that all these early ornamenta} windowa
were in the Mosaic style of art, and that the various glass was
coloured by the combination of the metallic oxides with the glass
