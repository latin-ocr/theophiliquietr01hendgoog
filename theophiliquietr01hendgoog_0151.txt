orpiment. Agnis, in the imitation of the ralubon, c. 16, manisc,
as a violet colour, is conjoined with cinnabar and with yellow,
⁰ both of which it would carry out; in the same chapter directions
are given to shade manisc with folium, a little blaclr being added
at the extremity. lt is evident that it isa tendet colour, as veneda
is directed to he first laid on if used upon walls, and the word ap
pears to imply that class of colours possessing a violet tint rather
than indicative of any particular substance. 1 have found receipts
for the manufacture of a bluish or violet colour from the petals
of the violet llower‚ which would be little permanent, aud which
baa probably, as woad, disappearcd aller the introduction of
indigo.

Mimos, c. 14. lt is remarkable that although Theophrastus has
accurately described the miltos and cinnabar of the Greeks, he
has made no mention of minium or the “ red oxide of lead.'’

A great confusion of terms has unfortunatel y occurred amongst
the ancient writers with respect to minium, and numerous errors
have arisen from the reproduction of these inaccuracies. The
minium of the Romans was sometimes our “vermilion,” or
“sulplruret of mercury,'' sometimes our “minianu” or “prot-
oxide of lead,'’ sometimes the ἕ( red ochres,” as the “minium
sinopium '¹ of Pliny.

Dioscorides¹ signalises this error. ‘⁸ Some erroneously believe
that minium is identical with cinnabar‚” bro. The minium of
Dioscorides was produced from a galena. “ For² minium is made
from au argentiferous stone mixed with sand.’' Was this the
“artificial cinnabar'’ of Theophrastus invented by Callias the

Ἴ Athenian in the reign of Praxibulus, only ninety years before his

time³l This would account for the confusion of terms.

The ‘⁶ minium ’' manufactured from cerussa iscalled ‘⁴ sandyx ’⁹
by Dioscorides, L. 5, c. 57. This term for minium was adopted
afterwards in Italy, as Hieron. Cardenus says that minium was
also called ‘⁸ sandyx,” and that “sandix '' was a term also applied to
bumt ochre; and in the much quoted line of Virgil,

“ Sponte sud sandyx pascentes vestiet agnos,”
This latter colonr would seem to be intended, rather than
