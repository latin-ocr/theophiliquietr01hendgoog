ornaments were introduced into Rome¹; probably from the latter
csuse.

Erochos, “De Artibus Romanorum,” is the only author, with
the exception 01 Theophilus, who makes mention 01 “vitrum
gallienum ;'' snd, fortunately‚ his chapter upon 11111 subjectis not
lost to us². Alter describing the manufacture 01 white glast,
Eraclius proceeds to direct the colouring 01 11.

“Si vero vis ut efficiatur rubeum de cinere temen³ bene cocto
sic facies.”

“But should you wish to make 1 red 110111 the ‘ashes’ well
cooked, however, you act thus. Take the filing 01 copper, sud
burn it until it becomes powder‚ and plece it into the small vessels
01 glast, end it will becomes red gloss, which we call Gallien :'’
‘⁶ quem Gallienum vocamus.”

The “ Gallien,’' then, wss the deep carmine-coloured glsss pro·
cured 110111 1 protoxide 01 copper, which is now generally flashed
upon 1 white glsss, as, unless worked 11 soon 11 the red colour
appears, it becomes 011 tint 100 intense, to be servicesble.

The MS. Sloane, 1754, already quoted, fol. 153, contains 1
recipe sor 1 red glsss.

“Is you wish to make beautiful, clear, and shining red stones,
take 100 drachms 01 your cristal,” and two and shall drachms 01
blaclr oxide 01 11011,(1111ς111111111111,)11111111111 magnetis stone

place 1110 coolr 101 five days and five nights in the pot, then witb-
draw the fire sud allow it to cool.’'

Pliny also mentions this protoxide 01 iron for the purpose 01
staining glase. “Caeptus eddi et magnes lapis3 quonism inse
liquorem vitri quoque, ut serrum, trahere creditur.''⁴
