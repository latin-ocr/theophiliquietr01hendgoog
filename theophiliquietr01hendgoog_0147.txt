gemsare divided into male and female; he instances the “ cyanus,''
of which he is not then treating, as being divided in the same
manner. Hill continues the error of previous commentatore,
Philander, De Laet, C. Leonardus, dcc, dte, dte.

Theophrastus tells us that the sappltire was spotted, as it were,
with gold, “ gysa-laagorff’ llill denies this to be the lapis lazuli,
following De Boot, who writes, “Quam gemman Plinius sapphi-
rum vocat, cyanus est, seu lapis lazuli,” a double error, divided
between both the critics.

But Theophrastus says that¹ “The native cyanus,'' (or lapis ξ
armenus) ‘⁶ atavi< adropuhr” has ln it “ chrysocolla,'' “ χρυσοκόλλαι,”
which, with the ancients, was a green oxide of copper. Hill here
admits this to mean th'e lapis armenus, attempting to avoid the ³
dilemma by making the cyanus before mentioned a ²⁸ gem,” for· 3

getting that there were more than oue kind of “cyanus''
In c. 90, Theophrastus places adam, cyanus, and “ chryso·
colla” among colours used by painters.

Hill, having apparently perplexed himself, accuses Pliny of cou-
fusiou², and, having embroiled the question, asserts that Pliny has ¹

misunderstood Theophrastus. This is both unlilrely and erroneous.

Pliny “De Jaspidum generibus¹' l. 37. c. 9, describes cyanus, ¹

and after mentioniug, as Theophrastus, that tlte Egyptian kind was
“ tinctured,’' proceeds, “Dividitur autem et hot: in mares foemi-
nasque. lnest ei aliquando et aureus pulvis, uon qualitiva sapphi-
rinis.'’ lle follows with “Sareurnus rrruu ss sunnis noueris
consuens. “ Ceruleae ct sapphiri, raroque cum purpura. Optime
apud Medos, nusquam tamen perlucidae,'’ dic, certainly a dis·
tinction is made here between the cyanus and the sapphirus.

The deep blue, “lapis armenus'’ or cyanus, is even now cut for 3

omaments; some of this so closely resembles sapphirus or lapis

laauli that it is only by the test of fire, which destroys the blue

colour of the native carbonata of copper‚ the two are to be distin·

guished. De Boot²³, upon lapis laauli, gives this true test of the 3

stone. “ Fixus lapis lazuli, hoc est, qui igni impositus colorem
non mutat.''

“The lapis laauli is permanent, that which is placed in the
lire does not change colour, this is the legitimate proof; it is mnstly
