mechanical process of gilding aster the working and polishing of
the enamels or gloss geme, eprocess which, says the Abos Texier,
is always observable in the Romaic gilt and enamelled work; sub-
mitted to a moderate hest, sufficient for the sublimation of the

mercury‚ the ‘⁸ electra,” or gloss geme remained uninjured. The
whole process is worthy attention as is the preparation for receiv-

ing the gilding called “ invivare,” by Theophilus, consisting of
bitartrate of potasse, muriate of roda, and quicksilver.

0. XL. “OF COLOURING GOLD.”

'l'he process here described is calculated to produce the same
action upon the surfsce of an impure gold as that followed by
submitting it to the action of a diluted muriatic aeid. Atramentum
or the sulphate os copper, (or iron,) having been partly deprived
of the sulphuric scid it contains, is again subjected to beat in the
presence of muriate os soda and the urie salte, upon the suriaco ol
the gold to be purified. The result would form a certain propor-

tion of muriatic acid which, remoring the nlloy it might contain,
would render the gold pure, thereby colouriug, or rather de-co·
louring the metal.

The reed, called also syphon, canna, calamus, etc„ was an in·
strument formerly used in the Roman church in the service of
communion, in order to withdraw the wine from the chalice for

Its use was preserved during along time in many monasteries²;
at Cluny, at St. Denis³‚ in the ceremonies of the consecration of
the Kings os Franco ⁴: now the Pope alone employs it in the cele·
bration of Roman ceremonies.

The Benedictines, authors of tlte ‘¹ Voycge Litteroire‚'' describe
a need, which they saw in the treasury ol the Abbey os Corbie:
