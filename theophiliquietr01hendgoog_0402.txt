and other ligures of any sorm or sex, which being impressed
upon gold or silver, or gilt copper, give the greatest ornament
to the places upon which they are placed, on account ol their
lineness and labour. The figures of kings and knights are

also made iu the same manner in iron, with which, impressed
upon Spanish brass, the basius, srom which water is poured
upon the hands, are ornamented in tbe same manner in which
caps are embellished, with gold or silver‚ with their borders

two parts of tin and a third ol' lead, and beat it out thin and
