Water was the first product; then come over slight-coloured
empyreumatic oil, which gradually became of a darker colour,

mixed with urater during the whole process ol distillation.

The ebullition iu the retort uas at first great, but it gradually
lessened as the oil became of greater substance. The beatis required
to be increased to keep up the vapour producing the distilled oil.
As the process continued, this vapour became more abundant, and
a quantity ol'gas was liberated, to allow of the escape of which the
stopper in the receiver must be grensed and loosely dropped into
its place; care should be taken to visit this osten, in order to guard
against explosion. lt appears to me during this process that oil
will not spontaneously take lire at a great heat3 it requires contact
with flaute or a red beat in order to do so.

Carbonic aeid and crrrlrurcllcd hydrogen gas are the principsl
gases produced. This mixture os gases, probably owing to the
great excess of carburetted hydrogen‚ is highly inflammable: it is
the productiori of this, not ol' a highly inflammoble volatile oil,
which causes oil‚ raised to every high temperature, to talce lire

hot iron, dre,
