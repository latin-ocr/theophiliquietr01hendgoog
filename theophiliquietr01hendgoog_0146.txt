conjunctius ol' the reeds at the top ol the habitation (or temple).
Or “ laquearia” are what are laid over the beams and are inter-
woven with those bearna. Also laquearia are those works which
cover and ornament apartments3 hence Josephus in Vlll⁰, “De
lignis celatis, opere laqueario, auroque vestitis.”

Thus, from originally denoting the interwoven wood, reed, or
plaster work, the word became applied to the ornaments with which
that work was covered, and in such sense it is used by Theophilus.

St. Isidore, L. xix. c. 12, Originum ; thus refers to laquearia.

“ Laquearia sunt quae cameram subtegunt et ornant, quae et
lacunaria dicuntur: quod lacus quosdam quadratos vel rotundos
ligno vel gipso vel coloribus habeat pictos, curn signis intermican-
tibus.''

Jsasnrarr, c. 22, v. 14. “Et facit laquearia cedrina, pingitque
synopide,‘' ⁸⁶ and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with ainoper,¹'
(translated vermilion in the English version.)

Pliny tells us that Pamphilus, the master of Apelles, instituted
the custom os painting “lacunaria'' or the intervals between
bearna or arches upon walls, and adds “ nec cameras ante eurn
taliter adornari rnos suit.’'

Lazos, c. 14. The Lazur of Theophilus is doubtless the male
cyanus of the Greeks, the deep blue lapis armenus, the dinarios,
ιυαιός, of Theophrastus, which has, as yet, been confounded with
the lapis laridi, or Greek σάπφειρος.

Theophrastus mentions among the valuable stones “adspargas’'
‘⁴ Sapphire,'' which isos a dark dye¹‚ and not very different frona
the male cyanus “ κυανδς.” This comparison, Hill remarks, “ is a
confirmation that the sapphire and cyanus are not the same stone,
as they are compared together; ¹’ it may be added that it identifies
the sapphire with the lapis lazuli, the cyanus being of two
ltinds, divided into male and female, the male being ol a deeper
colour². Yet Hill here unfortunately falls into error, as he re-
marks that “ this cyanus is a gem, and is the lapis lazuli of
which ultramarine is made,'' whereas that colour is only truly
made from the sapphire of the Greeks, the true “lapis lazuli.”
Theophrastus does not speak of cyanus “as a gem” at all;
noticing that in the “carnelian ’⁹ and the “lapis lyncurius”
