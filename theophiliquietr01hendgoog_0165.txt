the first positive direction sor the use os linseed nil, as avehieie
for paint and a varnish, is found.

This MS. is stated by Muratori¹ to be oi the eighth century;
itis rather carelessly given by him, contains, directions sor dyeing
skins, making coloured glass, the compositiones colours, varnishes,
dre„ and a description of various substanees used in the arts.
Linseed oil is thus noticed in it. “Lineleon, ex semine lini fit,'’
p. 372, is thennim of Dioscorides and the λιιόλαδοι of the rno-
dem Greeks 3 iinseed oil.

The recipe for a composition for pigmenta or varnirb is given.
“ Dc compositio Linei,'' p. 380. ‘⁴ Compositio; Lineileum ib. 11.
gumma ÷ (sescuncia) resina suppini ÷ 1. Omnia trita, de-
coquantur in vaso terrae?

“The composition of Lineum.” Linseed oil, alim gum san·
darach, 1334 Larch (or Venice) turpentine resin, 133. Ab
ground, they are eooked inan earthen vessei.”

There is no doubt here os an oil varnish, or vehicle which was
used by the Greek painters. Again, “De Lineleo.'' “ Lineieon
accuratione, Lineleon liber ll. gumms ÷, resina ÷ crocus soli·
dus lun. Ista trita et commisce, quemadmodum superius.'’

‘¹ Os Lineleon.” “Linseed oil inspissatcd, (quasi ab exareo, to
wax dry,) or boiled linseed oil, arba gum sandarach, ¹333 pine
resin, 1333 solid yellow, ab. These, ground and mixed together
as above.’' 1f this crocus solidus is the yellow aloes, it is a var·
nish which hasbeen much in use at a ister period in Italy. It may,
however, be an ochre, and the composition one sor iaying on gold3
it proves, however, the mixture os varnish with colours, and it is
sverycurious circumstance, that at a very early period in Eng-
iand painters were called “ gilders.’'

The composition os a varnish which is called “lucidis” is s

singular mixture, some os the ingrediente given not being, under ’
any circumstances, soluble in oil. 1 give the whole chapter for
the curione.
