now called moulds. You place these, persectly dry, at the
lire, and when they have become warm, pour out the melted
wax into water, and you again place them 11 the firc, aud you
do thus until you have removed all the wax. Alter this you
lay lorge and cold coals in 1 fit aud smooth place, upon which
you establish the moulds with the openings turned down·
warde, and you place around them some hard stones which
cannot fly to pieces hythe heat 01 the fire, and you will
arrange them stone upon stone like a wall, dry without mor·
tar, so that between the stenes many small openings may re·
main. These being thus arranged, higher by hall a 1001 than
ure the moulds, spread around the hot coals, and then the
cold, unto the top, and take care that such space be between
the moulds and the stonesas may contain the coals. When
111 the coals are glowing, they are sometimes to be stirred
with ethin wood on every side through the openings between
the stones, that they may be closed together, and the heat be
equel everywhere. And when they have descended so much
that you can see the moulds, again fill up to the top with cold
coals, and do thus 1 third time. And when you see the
moulds glow outside, place the vessel in the firc with the
brass which you wish to cast, and you will blow slightly at
first, theu more and more until it be quite liquefied. This being
done, careiirlly stir it with an instrument bent and fixed in
wood, and turn it into another wide (rossel), again fill it with
bross and heat it, and do thus until the vessel be filled, and
you will again stir it with the curved instrument and will
purge it from coals, and blowing strongly with the bellows
you will cover it with large eoals. The stones being then
removed, you take the moulds from the tire and caresully
plaster clay, plentifully sprinkled with water and thinned like
lees, with a cloth, and so a trough being made near 111111-

up earth on cvery side and carelirlly compress it with 1 picce

placed in 1 piece 01 split wood, and the vessel being taken
from the tire with the pincers curved at the end, and the

small cloth being applied which can defend it from dust and
