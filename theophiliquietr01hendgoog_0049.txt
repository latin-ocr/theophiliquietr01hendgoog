Having shown, in a note to L. I. p. 63, of what the
varnish of Theophilus was composed, and which was
employed during the early period of art, there is every
reason to believe that “ Annua Vnnnrsn” was one of
the inventione of the brothers Van Eyck3 and that this
invention was carried into the school of Venice we have
proof ¹. The head of a Venetian Doge, by John Bellini,
in the National Gallery, is painted with this varnish.
Mr. Eastlake pointed out to me the amber beads
banging upon the wall, in the picture by Van Eyck,
in the same place: this is a eurious circumstance worth
notice.

In the manuscript, Sloane 345, Pl. 85 C, which
contains a series of medical writings, “ Traot. Var. Me·
dioinal.'’ collected by J ohannes Ketham, who flourished
towards the latter part of the fifteenth century, is a

book upon colours and materiale for painting, written in
old Dutch or Flemish, and which should therefore be of

an earlier period in tbe same century. In this I found ,

the lirst mention of amber vamish yet upon record, aud
it arrives from the country of Van Eyck. The MS. is
extremely difficolt to read.
