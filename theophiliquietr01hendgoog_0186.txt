Ι, deniring to be the imitator of thie man, have
approaehed the poroh of holy Sophia, and beheld the
ehanoel lilled with every variety of divers 00101110, and
showing forth the nature and utility 01 each. From
which, having forthwith entered vvith unwatohed foot-
rtep, Ι filled np the atorehonee of my heart fully, out
ol all; which I have eet forth with olearnesa, having, by
0110101 experiment, thoroughly examined one by one
101 ]001 study, all these things sufficiently approved by
the eye and hands, without jealonny. But sinae the
praetioe of thia kind of emhellinhment cannot be of
qniek apprehension, like a diligent inquiret I have
greatly laboured to inform myaelf, by all methodo, what
invention 01 art and variety of 0010111 may beautifya
structure and not repel the light 01 day and the rays 01
the sun. Applying myaelf to thie 01010100, I comprise

the nature of glane, and Ι consider that thia ean be
effeeted hythe nee and variety of it alone. This art,
10 nean and reported Ι have learned, I have laboured,
101 your observanoe, to iathom.
