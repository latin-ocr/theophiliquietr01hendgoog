the thicker wood a square hole must be made in the centre,
four lingens in breadth, and about which, borders must be left
of the same wood of one finger in breadth and height, in
which the bellows can be placed. lu the upper part ol the
side, however, small hollows are made, through which the
wind can arrive at tbe pipes. But the other part nithe
wood, which should also be uppermost, is measured out in-
cide equally, where seven or eight small openings are dis-
poscd, in which the stops are carelirlly joined, so that they
may bave an easy means of being drawn out or restored, so
however, that no air can come out between the joina.

ln the upper part, however, cut small openings opposite
the lower ones, which may be rather wider, in which may bc
joined so many picces of wood, so that between these and
the larges, the openings of the wood may remain empty
through which the wind can mount to the pipes; lor in these
same picces of wood openings should be made in which the
piper are to be made fast. The openings in which the stops
are fitted in the front pert should increase, like slanting win-
dows, through which these stops are introduced and removed.

ln the hinder pertundet the end ol these stops, holca are
made equally wide and longos the sine ol two fingers, through
which the wind can ascend from the lower to the upper parts,
⁸0 that when the stops are preased upon them these holes
may be stopped by them, when, however, they are withdrawn
lbey may again lie open. ln those pieces of wood which ure
l0iued upon the stops openings are made, carefully and in
ὓῐᾶεῐ, according to the number of the pipes oi every tone,
illwhich these pipes are placed, so that they may stand firmly
and receive the wind from the lower parts. But in the handles
Of the stops letters are marked, according to the rise and full
0l the sound, by which it can be known which tone it may

be· ln each one oi the stops single slender boles ure made,
balsos the little finger in length, in the sront part, near the
lmdles, lengtbwise‚ in which single copper headed nails may
beplaced, which may pass through the small windows in the
middle, by means ol which these stops ure drawn from the
llpper side ol the construction down to the lower, and the
