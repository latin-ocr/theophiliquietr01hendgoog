with oil: Pliny concludes his notice of the resins by the statement
that every resinis dissolved in oil. ‘¹ Resina omnis dissolvitur in
oleo 3 ’⁹ the word ‘⁴ coquenti '¹ is thus explained.

Sandarsc was called “sandaracha Arabum,” during the middle
ages, by most of the writers on physics3 one example will suffice.
Caneparias “de atramentis ”¹ writes, “De vernias, qua effingun-
tur coria aurata. Cape oleum lini ad pondus librarum trium,
amnicis, vulgo appellatur sandaracha Arabum, libra una‚” 810, dac.
Andrea Alpagus² calls sandarac “sanderos,” and adds “est
almedou, et est vernix quae dicitur sandaracha.”

ln a manuscript belonging to the lloyal Lihrsry at hlontpellier, of
tbe early part 01 the fifteenth century, sud which is principally 3
collection of authors upon medical subjects, is a small treatise upon
the asts. This MS. was kindly placed at my disposal by M. Libri,
of the Sorbonne, Paris ³.

From this MS. l give some extracts which will show what the
“ sornis ” or ‘⁶ glassa ’⁹ was.

“De glutine vernicon.

“Pone oleum lini in ollam novam parvam, adde gummi quod
vocatur fernix vel massa, minutissime tritum, et assimilatur thuri:
deiude ponatur ad lentum ignem et coquatur, ita ut non bulliat,
usque dum tertia pars consumatur, omnino et caveatur ab igne,
quod multum periculosum est, et de levi non extinguitur.''

“Ad vernicem.

“Accipe glassa, vel fornix grana, estque idern quod vernix, et
fac eam lente liquare, et bullito oleo linosae, insimul misce, eom-
rhixtum ita tractu, dimitte bene coopertum donec frigescat.’'

ltwill be seen that these are, in substance, the two chapters olour
author, that the “ fernix,’' ‘⁴ grassa,’' “glassa,” and “vernis ” 310
synonymous, and explain Theophilus. “ Grassa” is the llloorish

aud 3 Spanish term sor sandarao: the substitution 01 the r sor 1,
is common also with the 'Neapolitan and Roman people.
