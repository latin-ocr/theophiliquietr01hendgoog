placed the desire to explore the vast field ol the divers
arte, and to bring thereto intellect and care, that thou
mayest afterwards collect therefrom that which may
please thee, think not thou cheaply of any precious and
useful things; as if the domestic soil produced them
for thee spontaneously, or unsought ior; he would be a
loolish calculator who suddenly finding a treasure in a
holein the ground, should neglect to gather and keep it.

perhaps morevile in comparison? this, in thine own

with the greatest care some precious things sought
with much labonr and acquired with great expense,
yet, if by chance they are sometimes met with cheaply,
or like, or better things, are found, they are preserved

with a similar, yes, witha greater care. d
