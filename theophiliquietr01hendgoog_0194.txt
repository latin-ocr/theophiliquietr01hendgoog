HOW GLASS ranem ABE UADB.

In the morning, however, at the first honr, take the iron tube,
and, if you wish to make platea of gloss, place the end of it
in a vase full of gloss 3 when it bas adhered to it, turn this
tube round in your hand until as mnch as yon may wish has
accumulated around it ; then, withdrawing it, bring it to your
mouth and blow slightly, and instantly removing it from the
mouth, hold it near your cheek, unless, in drawing hreath,
you may by chance attract the flame into your mouth. Here
also a flat stone before the window upon which you beat thia
glowing glanna little, that it may hang equally on every side,
immediately and with quickness, repeatedly blowing, so osten
you remove it from the mouth. When you see it look like a
long hladder, bring the end of it towards the flame, and,
being instantly melted, an opening will appear, and, the piece
of wood fitted for this work being taken, make the opening
as wide as is the gloss in the middle. , 'l'hen join ita mouth
together, namely, the upper to the lower part, so thatun both
sides of the junction an opening may appear. Instantly
touch this glass near the tube with a moist piece of wood,
shake it a little, and it will be separated. Presently also beet
the tube in the fleme os the fornace, until the gloss attached to
it liquefy, and, with rapidity, place it upon the two conjoined
borders of glass, and it will adhere; directly taking this up,
put it into the flameof the fornace until the opening, whence
you formerly separated the tube, is liquefied, and the round
piece of wood being taken, dilate it as the other, and folding
together its mouth in the middle and separating it from the
pipe with the moist wood, give it to the boy, who, introducing
a piece of wood through the opening, will carry it to the
cooling oren, which is made moderately warm. This kind of
glans is pure and white. ln the same manner, and at the
same time, make similar pieres of glass until you exhaust the
reses.
