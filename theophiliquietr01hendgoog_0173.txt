for it is also sometimes found in the iron mines. There are also,
besides these, the Lemnian and Sinopic miltos; there are par·
ticular pits in Lemnos, in which nothing but the earth is dug.”¹

The Lemnian miltos must not, however, be coufounded with
the “coemto'’ or “terra sigillata.’¹ The scaled earth, used in
medicine, was an unctuous clay, of apale red colour, which was
mixed by the priests alone, with the blood of goats sacrificed,
aud then sealed by them. lt was the “Lemnian reddle,” not the
“Lemnian earth,” which was used by painters ². Pliny con·
founds the two substancesl.

Salmasius was the first to detect an important error in the
different editions of Pliny, sud to restore a passage, according to
his judgment, to the original intention of the author ⁴.

The passage ³, “Milton vocant Groeci minium, quidam cinna-
bari,” “the Greeks call minium miltos, some cinnabar,” has been
restored by him to “(llubicam) milton vocant Graeci, minium que
cinnabari;¹’ a statement which would be certainly correct, and
therefore fairly attributable to Pliny, many of whose “arma''
have been more the mistakes of his cominentators than his own.

Salmasius thus restores the whole passage: “Jam enim 'l'ro-
janis temporibus rubrica in honore erat, qui naves ea commendat,
alias circa picturas, pigmentaque rarus, milton vocant Graeci,
miniumque cinnabari.'’ The milton certainly relates to the ru·
brion. llill remarks‘¹‚ that “Homer, speaking of the Grecian
ships, writes ‘Nise μιλτοπαςῆους,’ and that it is impossible ha
should mean by it that they were stained with minium or cin-
nabar, which was not known till after his timc.’'

This correction of an error which has so long existed, and
been variously propagated, is certainly important. Sinoper or
miltos has been used as a colour from time immemorial, and we
have proof that the Egyptians used it: the Assyriam lilrcwise.
Eaekiel, c. xxiii, v. 14, speaks of ‘⁴ men pnrtrayed upon the wall,
the likeness of the Chaldeans portrayed with sinoper.” The
