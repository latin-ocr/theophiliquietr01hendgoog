in the copper, in order without the tin, and intermingle ceals,
casting them abundantly above it, and ignited eoals being
cast in, cause the bellows to commence blowiug, at first
moderately, then more and more. And when you see a green
fleme ascend, now the copper begins to melt, 8ηά immedi-
ately superposing coela plentifirlly, run back to the mould
fumace, and with the long tongs begin to pluck out the
stanes, and to throw them away. This work does uot de-
mand in this place slothful, but agile and diligent workmen,
lest through neglectos any kind either the mould be broken,
ovone may hinder or burt the other, or provoke him to anger,
which is above all to be guarded against. The stenes end fire
being ejected, the earth must be again hastily replaced, that
the hollow about the mould may be again carefully filled up;
and there may be those who are always passing round with
blunted pieces of wood, beatiug moderately and trampling
lirmly with the fect, thet the earth which is placed in may
press upon the mould, lest when the weight of the bruas is

poured in, it in any wey be broken. The hollow being then ¹

m this manner filled up to the top, return quickly to the pots,
and with 8 long and charred piace of wood stir the copper, aud

into the handles of the pot, and active men being called, skilful
in this art, cause it to be raised with every care and carried to
the mould, and the coals and ashes being thrown out and the
strainer eloth put on, cause it to be poured in hardily. ln the
meantime lie down, near the mouth of the mould, carefully
remarking, by listening, how far within it may proceed 3 and
should you perceive aa if a slight murmur of thunder, de·
sire that they hold a little, and then again that they
pour in; and so that sometimes by holding and again by
pouring, the brass be made to subside evenly, until that

pot be empty. Which being removed, another brought into
the same place must be set up directly, the same is done with
this aa with the former, and in like manner with a third until
the brusa is seen in the sunuel. Nor may the pot be imme-
