and re-rotation the saud has began to bubble and be diffused
’ over the stone, ,collect it again always, and replace it in the

hollow with a small, long, aad thin wood‚ unless by chance

completely ground it is taken out and washed and dried as .
above, and it is placed upon a scale. ll, however, any should

the gold is liquefied and mixed with the quiclcsilver. And
